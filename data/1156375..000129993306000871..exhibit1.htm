development of CME&#146;s services and products, including CME&#146;s trading programs and systems,
current and potential customer and business relationships, and business strategies and plans
requires substantial time and expense. Such efforts generate for CME valuable and
proprietary information (&#147;Confidential Information&#148;) which gives CME a business advantage
over others who do not have such information. Confidential information includes, but is not
limited to the following: trade secrets, technical, business, proprietary or financial
information of CME not generally known to the public, business plans, proposals, past and
current prospect and customer lists, trading methodologies, systems and programs, training
materials, research data bases and computer software; but shall not include information or
ideas acquired by Employee prior to his employment with CME if such pre-existing information
is generally known in the industry and is not proprietary to CME. Employee further
acknowledges that during Employee&#146;s employment by CME, Employee&#146;s duties will expose
Employee to Confidential Information, and Employee understands and acknowledges that each
and every component of the Confidential Information constitutes a protectible business
interest of CME.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 12pt">(ii)&nbsp;Throughout Employee&#146;s employment with the Company and at all times thereafter: (1)
Employee will hold all Confidential Information in the strictest confidence, take all
reasonable precautions to prevent its inadvertent disclosure to any unauthorized person, and
follow all CME policies protecting the Confidential Information; (2)&nbsp;Employee will not,
directly or indirectly, utilize, disclose, or make available to any other person or entity,
any of the Confidential Information, other than in the proper performance of Employee&#146;s
duties during Employee&#146;s employment with CME; and (3)&nbsp;if Employee learns that any person or
entity is taking or threatening to take any action which would compromise any Confidential
Information, Employee will promptly advise CME of all facts concerning such action or
threatened action.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 12pt">(iii)&nbsp;If Employee receives any subpoena or becomes subject to any legal obligation that
might require Employee to disclose Confidential Information, Employee will provide prompt
written notice of that fact to CME, enclosing a copy of the subpoena and any other documents
describing the legal obligation. In the event that CME objects to the disclosure of
Confidential Information, by way of a motion to quash or otherwise, Employee agrees to not
disclose any Confidential Information while any such objection is pending.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 12pt">(iv)&nbsp;At the request of CME (or, without any request, upon termination of Employee&#146;s
employment with the Company for any reason), Employee will immediately deliver to CME (i)
all property of the Employer that is then in Employee&#146;s possession, custody or control,
including, without limitation, all keys, access cards, credit cards, computer hardware
(including but not limited to any hard drives, diskettes, laptop computers and personal data
assistants and the contents thereof, as well as any passwords or codes needed to operate any
such hardware), computer software and programs, data, materials, papers, books, files,
documents, records, policies, client and customer information and lists, marketing
information, design information, specifications and plans, data base information and lists,
mailing lists, notes, and any other property or information that Employee has relating to
the Company (whether those materials are in paper or computer-stored form), and (ii)&nbsp;any and
all documents or other items containing, summarizing, or describing any Confidential
Information, including all originals and copies.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 12pt">b) <U>Non-Competition</U> For a period of one (1)&nbsp;year following the termination of
Employee&#146;s employment with CME for any reason, the Employee will not (i)&nbsp;be employed in an
executive or managerial capacity by, or (ii)&nbsp;provide, whether as an employee, independent
contractor, consultant, or otherwise, any services of an executive or managerial nature or
any services similar to those provided by the Employee to CME during Employee&#146;s employment
with CME to, any exchange, stock depository or clearing organization. Employee acknowledges
that the restrictions contained in this Paragraph&nbsp;2 are necessary to protect CME&#146;s
legitimate interests in its Confidential Information and customer relationships.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 12pt">c) <U>General</U>. Upon termination for any reason, Employee shall return to Employer all
records, memoranda, notes, plans, reports, computer tapes and equipment, software and other
documents or data which constitute Confidential Information which he may then possess or
have under his control (together with all copies thereof) and all credit cards, keys and
other materials and equipment which are Employer&#146;s property that he has in his possession or
control. If, at any time of enforcement of this Section&nbsp;7, a court holds that the
restrictions stated herein are unreasonable, the parties hereto agree that a maximum period,
scope or geographical area reasonable under the circumstances shall be substituted for the
stated period, scope or area and that the court shall be allowed to revise the restrictions
contained herein to cover the maximum period, scope and area permitted by law.

<P align="center" style="font-size: 11pt"><B>CME Relocation Assistance for John P. Davidson III</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt">CME offers a competitive relocation assistance policy to ease the transition an employee may
encounter in relocating to the Chicago area. Accordingly, CME will reimburse you for certain
relocation expenses related to your move, as described below. To be reimbursed, all relocation
expenses must be incurred by 6/30/2008.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt"><U><B>Reimbursable Expenses</B></U>



<P align="left" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 11pt"><B>Temporary Housing</B>: If you must begin work before you have had an opportunity to find
permanent housing in the Chicago area, CME will reimburse you for the reasonable cost of
renting a 2 bedroom apartment (furnished or unfurnished), not to exceed $3000 per month for
a period of up to fourteen months. If you have not moved your own car to Chicago, we will
also reimburse you for the reasonable costs of renting a car during this period.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 11pt"><B>Moving of Household Goods</B>: Up to a maximum of $13,000, CME will reimburse you for basic
moving services, including packing and unpacking of normal household goods, appliance
servicing, insurance coverage for full replacement value, and other related expenses,
including the temporary (less than six months) storage of your household items before or
after your move. (CME will not pay for the moving of airplanes, boats, recreational
vehicles, utility sheds, firewood, more than three vehicles or other items of excessive
bulk.)



<P align="left" style="margin-left:8%; font-size: 11pt"><I>Special Note About Insurance: </I>Moving some personal valuables requires that you
identify, or declare them specifically, so that your relocation coordinator can get
special permission and make insurance arrangements. They include jewelry, furs,
money, animals, fine art, antiques, securities or collectibles. If you fail to
declare those items, insurance will not cover any expenses related to their loss.
Please ensure that you make all required declarations because the CME will not
reimburse you for any losses associated with your move. (This expense was not in the
original agreement.)



<P align="left" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 11pt"><B>Moving Days: </B>CME will authorize three paid moving days, in addition to any vacation or
personal days for which you might be eligible, to allow you to complete your physical move
and get settled in your new residence.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 11pt">Miscellaneous Allowance: CME will provide an allowance of $5,000 for miscellaneous expenses
associated with setting up your new household. This includes items such as cable
installation or hook-up, driver&#146;s license fees and license plates, vehicle stickers or
providing window or floor coverings in your new residence. This allowance is available to
you once you have closed on your new home. Please provide a copy of your closing documents
on your new home to obtain this allowance.


<P align="center" style="font-size: 10pt; display: none">5
<!-- PAGEBREAK -->


<P align="left" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 11pt">Similarly, if you prefer to rent, the CME will provide an allowance of $2,500 for
miscellaneous expenses. This amount may be applied toward your security deposit or other
expenses associated with setting up your residence. Please provide a copy of your signed
lease to obtain this allowance.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt"><U><B>Reimbursement Procedures</B></U>



<P align="left" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 11pt">To be eligible for reimbursement of the above expenses, you must complete an expense report
and submit all documentation and original receipts to the Organizational Development
Division for processing.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt"><U><B>Your Repayment Obligations </B></U>



<P align="left" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 11pt">If you voluntarily leave CME within one year after your move, you must reimburse CME for all
of the payments made as part of your relocation.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt"><U><B>Return Trips Home</B></U>



<P align="left" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 11pt">CME will reimburse you for reasonable airfare and miscellaneous expenses (coach class
airfare or mileage) for you. Please note that CME has a preferred travel agency that will
need to be used to arrange travel accommodations.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt"><U><B>Tax Liability Assistance</B></U>



<P align="left" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 11pt">The Internal Revenue Service requires that reimbursement for some relocation expenses be
included in your gross income. This includes expenses the company reimburses directly to
you for house hunting trips and return trips home, for example. It includes any
reimbursement, which the IRS views as non-deductible (i.e., taxable) expenses.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 11pt">CME will make additional payments to the Internal Revenue Service and state taxing
authorities to compensate for taxes on non-deductible moving expenses. This is called the
tax liability assistance, also known as &#147;gross up&#148;. To be eligible, you must be employed
through the end of the calendar year in which you incurred the relocation expenses.
