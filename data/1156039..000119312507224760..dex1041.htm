Indianapolis, Indiana (&#147;<U>WellPoint</U>&#148;)<B>,</B> established this WellPoint, Inc. Executive Agreement Plan (&#147;<U>Plan</U>&#148;), effective as of January&nbsp;1,&nbsp;2006, and amended and restated the Plan effective November&nbsp;1,
2006. The Plan is hereby amended and restated in its entirety, effective October&nbsp;1,&nbsp;2007; provided, however, that with respect to any individual who became a Participant (as defined in Section&nbsp;8.1.12 below) in the Plan prior to
October&nbsp;1, 2007, such amendment and restatement shall be effective as of October&nbsp;1,&nbsp;2008 with respect to any provision of the Plan that adversely affects the rights to which such Participant was entitled to under the Plan prior to
October&nbsp;1,&nbsp;2007. The Plan is intended to protect key executive employees of WellPoint and its subsidiaries and affiliates (collectively, the &#147;<U>Company</U>&#148;) against an involuntary loss of employment so as to attract and retain
such employees, and motivate them to enhance the value of the Company. The Plan is intended to be an unfunded welfare plan subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (&#147;ERISA&#148;); or to the extent it is a
pension plan subject to ERISA, as an unfunded pension plan maintained primarily for the purpose of providing deferred compensation to a select group of management or highly compensated employees. Words and phrases used with initial capitals in the
Plan and not otherwise defined in the Plan have the meanings defined for them in Article 8. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:24px;margin-bottom:0px" ALIGN="center"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">ARTICLE 2 </FONT></P> <P
