shall be pro-rated in the same
manner as Base Rent under Article&nbsp;3 hereof. Within one hundred eighty (180)&nbsp;days following
each fiscal year as determined by
Landlord during the term hereof, Landlord shall submit to Tenant a statement (the &#147;Annual
Statement&#148;) in reasonable detail of the
actual Annual Operating Costs. If such statement shows that Tenant&#146;s share of the actual

Annual Statement, pay the total amount
of such deficiency to Landlord. Thereafter, upon receipt of such succeeding Annual statement,
Tenant&#146;s monthly payments during

event shall Tenant&#146;s Pro-Rata Share of Annual Operating Costs, excluding the Excluded Items (as
defined below) for the second
Lease Year of the Term or for any succeeding Lease Year increase by more than five percent
(5%) over the Annual Operating
Costs for the immediately preceding Lease Year; provided, however, that if the Annual
Operating Costs increase for any Lease Year
exceeds five percent (5%), then the amount of the Annual Operating Cost increase in excess of
five percent (5%) may be added
to the Annual Operating Cost increase for any succeeding Lease Year (or Lease Years) when the
Annual Operating Cost increase
is less than five percent (5%), so that, to the fullest extent possible (subject to the
maximum increase of five percent (5%) per Lease
Year in Annual Operating Costs provided for herein), Annual Operating Costs increases shall
reflect all increases in the Annual
Operating Costs occurring after the Lease Date; provided, however, that Tenants Pro-Rata Share
of Real Estate Taxes, snow
removal costs, utility rate increases, or insurance rate increases or any other cost Landlord
can reasonably demonstrate to be
increased beyond Landlord&#146;s reasonable control (the &#147;Excluded Items&#148;) shall not be subject to
the above limitations on increases
in Annual Operating Costs, and Tenant shall be obligated to pay its full Pro-Rata Share of the
Excluded Items. Notwithstanding
anything contained herein to the contrary, after the fifth (5th) Lease Year, Tenant shall pay
its full Pro-Rata Share of Annual
Operating Costs, without any limitations.

the obligations hereunder shall survive

operations and taxes imposed in
connection with any special taxing district. If the system of real estate taxation shall be
altered or varied and any new tax or levy
shall be levied or imposed on said land, buildings and improvements, and/or Landlord in

connection with this Lease or otherwise, Tenant shall be obligated to pay to Landlord, as
Additional Rent, a reasonable fee, in the amount set forth on a fee schedule adopted by Landlord

save Landlord harmless from all penalties, claims, and demands resulting from Tenant&#146;s failure or
negligence in this respect. &#147;Common Facilities&#148; means all areas provided by Landlord, from time

the contrary, if, after the initial improvements to the Premises, Tenant is obligated to make
alterations to the Premises pursuant to any law, order, rule or regulation, Landlord&#146;s consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld. Tenant shall provide Landlord with written notice of any such

wet laboratories, cabinetry, benches
and scientific equipment; provided Tenant shall repair any damage to the Premises upon removal of

provided, however, Landlord shall notify Tenant, at the time Tenant requests Landlord&#146;s approval to
make alterations, that Landlord
will or will not require Tenant to remove the proposed alterations from the Premises upon the
expiration or earlier termination of
this Lease. If Landlord requires Tenant to remove such alterations as aforesaid, Tenant shall
remove same, repair any damage
to the Premises upon removing same, and restore the Premises to the condition the Premises were in
upon delivery of same to
Tenant, at Tenant&#146;s sole cost and expense, ordinary wear and tear and damage due to casualty not
required to be repaired by

alterations and/or installations.
Landlord reserves the right, subject to Articles 22 and 52, to change, increase or reduce, from
time to time, the number,
composition, dimensions or location of any parking areas, signs, the Building name, service areas,
walkways, roadways or other
common areas or make alterations or additions to the Building, in its sole discretion. Landlord&#146;s

of ascertaining whether Tenant&#146;s
proposed alterations will have an adverse impact on the structural components or Common Facilities
of the Building and to insure
the aesthetic and architectural harmony of the Tenant&#146;s proposed alterations with the remainder of
the Building. No approval of

the work provided for therein
will comply with applicable codes, laws or regulations or be in conformance with any insurance or
other requirements which affect
the Premises or the Building, and Tenant shall have the sole responsibility of complying with all

Tenant shall have the right to terminate this Lease by giving to Landlord notice of such
termination within fifteen (15)&nbsp;days after Landlord provides notice of such good faith estimate.
In the event that Landlord or Tenant do not exercise a right of termination as provided in this

Tenant which Landlord is required
to repair, and a failure to so report shall make Tenant liable to Landlord for any expense, damage

without a court order, unless Tenant has failed to cure said monetary default within five (5)
days&#146; after receipt of written notice from
Landlord. Upon each such reletting, the rent received by Landlord in respect of such resetting
shall be applied first to the payment
of any indebtedness other than rent due hereunder from Tenant to Landlord, including interest
thereon; second, to the payment
of any loss and expenses of such reletting, including brokerage fees, attorneys&#146; fees and the
cost of such alterations and repair;
third, to the payment of rent due and unpaid hereunder, together with interest thereon as
herein provided; and the residue, if any,
shall be held by Landlord and applied in payment of future rent as the same may become due and
payable hereunder. Tenant
agrees to pay to Landlord, on demand, any deficiency that may arise by reason of such
reletting. Notwithstanding any such reletting
without termination, Landlord may at any time thereafter elect to terminate this Lease for
such prior default.

damages and expenses Landlord
may suffer or incur by reason of Tenant&#146;s default hereunder, including without limitation ,
the cost of recovering the Premises and
reasonable attorney fees. Tenant agrees that actual damages to Landlord resulting from
Landlord&#146;s exercise of the remedies set
forth in paragraphs (a)&nbsp;or (b)&nbsp;above, will be difficult to ascertain, and therefore, after a
default of Tenant hereunder, Tenant shall
also pay to Landlord &#147;Liquidated Damages&#148; for the failure of Tenant to observe and perform the
covenants of this Lease, which
at the election of Landlord, shall be either: (A) (x)&nbsp;the sum of
(i)&nbsp;the minimum monthly rent,
plus (ii)&nbsp;the Additional Rent payable
hereunder for the month immediately preceding such failure to operate, re-entry or
termination, less (z)&nbsp;the net amount, if any, of
the rents collected on account of the lease or leases of the Premises for each month of the
period which would otherwise have
constituted the balance of the term of this Lease, all of which sums shall become due and
payable by Tenant to Landlord upon
the first day of each calendar month during the otherwise unexpired portion of the term
hereof; or (B)&nbsp;the whole of said Liquidated
Damages calculated under clause (A)&nbsp;multiplied by the number of months then remaining in the
lease term, discounted to present
value at a rate of six percent (6%) per annum as of the date of termination or re-entry by
Landlord; provided, however, that in the
event Landlord shall relet the Premises and the rent received by Landlord in respect of such
reletting together with the discounted
Liquidated Damages paid by Tenant, less the costs and expenses incurred by Landlord in such
reletting, shall exceed the rent
reserved hereunder for that period which would otherwise have constituted the remainder of the
term hereof, then Landlord shall,
upon the expiration of the period which would have constituted the term of this Lease, refund
to Tenant the lesser of the amount
of such excess or the discounted Liquidated Damages theretofore paid by Tenant.

option (if such arrearage remains unpaid
after ten (10)&nbsp;days&#146; written notice to Tenant) declare the tenancy hereunder converted into a
tenancy from month to month, and
upon giving written notice to Tenant of the exercise of such option, Landlord shall forthwith

information about the proposed Transferee, its experience, its financial situation, its methods of
operation, and its impact on the Building, as a prudent businessman would require in making the

Landlord of any adverse or negative information in its possession concerning the proposed Transfer

In the event that Landlord fails to give Tenant written notice of its election hereunder within the
specified sixty (60)&nbsp;day period. Landlord shall be deemed to have denied its consent to the
proposed Transfer. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, Landlord will not
unreasonably withhold its consent to a Transfer provided (i)&nbsp;such Transferee&#146;s net worth shall be

will become a default of Tenant with passage of time unless cured. Landlord&#146;s refusal to consent
to a Transfer shall be deemed to be reasonable if the proposed Transferee is an entity that is
already an occupant of the Building or the Avenel Business Park unless Landlord (or its
affiliates) is unable to provide the amount of space required by such occupant. Further, Landlord

Transfer notice to Landlord, as evidenced by any two-way correspondence or other documents between

Exhibits referred to in this Lease and attached hereto are a substantive part of this Lease and are
incorporated herein by reference. In any legal proceeding respecting this Lease, this Lease will be
construed with equal weight for the rights of both parties, the terms hereof having been determined
by free and fair negotiation, with due consideration for the rights and requirements of both
parties. Both parties agree that they have had equal input into the wording and phraseology of the
provisions of this Lease, and that, therefore, no provision will be construed as drafted by one
party or the other, without respect to whose draft of this Lease the wording or phraseology arises.
If any of the typewritten portions of this Lease conflict with any of the printed provisions of
this Lease, the provisions set forth in the typewritten portions shall control; provided, however,
that to the extent the printed portions of this Lease may be read in a manner which will not
conflict with the provisions of the typewritten portions, then such interpretation shall be deemed

balance sheet, an earnings statement, statement of changes in financial position, statement of
changes in tenant&#146;s equity, and related footnotes, prepared in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. Such financial statements must be either certified by a CPA or sworn to as
to their accuracy by Tenant&#146;s most senior official and its chief financial officer. The financial
statements provided must be as of a date not more than 12&nbsp;months prior to the date of request.
Landlord shall retain such statements in confidence, but may provide copies to lenders and
potential lenders. Notwithstanding the foregoing to the contrary, so long as Tenant is a
wholly-owned subsidiary of the Guarantor herein, Tenant shall not be required to provide financial
statements to Landlord.

drawings and specifications, consistent with the approved Plans, and sufficient for Landlord to
bid out and construct all improvements desired by Tenant in the Premises (the &#147;Construction
Drawings&#148;). The Construction Drawings for Landlord&#146;s work shall be provided to Tenant for review,
but shall not be subject to Tenant&#146;s approval unless and to the extent the Construction Drawings
are materially inconsistent with the Plans, in which event Tenant&#146;s consent, which shall not be

Construction Drawings are not acceptable and what revisions will be required in order to make the
Construction Drawings acceptable to Tenant.
