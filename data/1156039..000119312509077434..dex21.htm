the defense as provided in the preceding two sentences, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to participate in such defense (including with counsel of its choice), at its sole expense, and the Indemnifying Party shall reasonably cooperate with
the Indemnified Party in connection with such participation. If the Indemnifying Party does not deliver to the Indemnified Party written notice within the Indemnity Notice Period that the Indemnifying Party will assume the defense of any such claim
or litigation resulting therefrom, the Indemnified Party may defend against any such claim or litigation in such manner as it may deem reasonably appropriate, at the cost of the Indemnifying Party, and the Indemnified Party may settle such claim or
litigation or agree to pay in full such claim or demand, which shall only be made with the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. In the event that the Indemnifying Party does not
assume the defense as provided in the immediately preceding sentence, the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to participate in such defense (including with counsel of its choice), at its own expense, and the Indemnified Party shall reasonably
cooperate with the Indemnifying Party in connection with such participation. In all cases the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall keep each other reasonably informed as to all matters concerning any third party claim and shall
promptly notify the other Party in writing of any and all significant developments relating thereto. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P>
