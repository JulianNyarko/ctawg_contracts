<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, the Trust maintains the Archstone-Smith Trust Equity Plan for
Outside Trustees as amended from time to time (the &#147;Plan&#148;), which is
incorporated into and forms a part of this Agreement; and


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, the Participant has been awarded a restricted share unit award

<P align="left" style="margin-left:3%; font-size: 10pt">For purposes of the Plan, &#147;Cause&#148; shall mean, in the reasonable judgment
of the Administrator (i)&nbsp;the willful and continued failure by the Trustee
to substantially perform his or her duties with the Trust after written
notification by the Trust, (ii)&nbsp;the willful engaging by the Trustee in
conduct which is demonstrably injurious to the Trust or any Related Trust,
monetarily or otherwise, or (iii)&nbsp;the engaging by the Trustee in egregious
misconduct involving serious moral turpitude. For purposes hereof, no
act, or failure to act, on the Trustee&#146;s part shall be deemed &#147;willful&#148;
unless done, or omitted to be done, by the Trustee not in good faith and
without reasonable belief that such action was in the best interest of the
Trust or Related Company. For purposes of this subsection, a Trustee&#146;s
service shall be deemed to be terminated by the Trust or the successor to
the Trust if the Trustee terminates service after a material reduction in
the Trustee&#146;s annual compensation as in effect immediately prior to the
Change in Control. If, upon a Change in Control, awards in other shares
or securities are substituted for outstanding Awards pursuant to Section
4.3, and immediately following the Change in Control the Trustee becomes
director of the entity into which the Trust merged, or the purchaser of
substantially all of the assets of the Trust, or a successor to such
entity or purchaser, the Trustee shall not be treated as having terminated
service for purposes of this Section&nbsp;4.13 until such time as the Trustee
terminates service with the merged entity or purchaser (or successor), as
applicable.

the Secretary of the Trust.

the Plan, provided that no such amendment or termination may materially
adversely affect the rights of the Participant awarded hereunder.

Trust has caused these presents to be executed in its name and on its behalf,
