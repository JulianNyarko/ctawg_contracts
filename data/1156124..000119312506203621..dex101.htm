Person), on the other hand, from the transactions contemplated by the Program Documents. For this purpose, the benefits received by GLAIC or the Trust (if applicable) shall be the aggregate value of the relevant Collateral, and the benefits received
by the Trustee shall be the Fees it has been paid up to that point, as the Trustee, less costs and unreimbursed expenses incurred by it, as Trustee, in relation to such Collateral, and the benefits received by the Trust (if applicable) shall be
determined by the Trustee and GLAIC. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding two sentences is not permitted by applicable law, then GLAIC shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by the Indemnified Person in such
proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of GLAIC and the Trust (if applicable) (but solely to the extent such fault results from or is attributable to the Trustee&#146;s bad faith, willful
