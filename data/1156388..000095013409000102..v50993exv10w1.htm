Hundred Seventy Three Thousand Dollars ($473,000) and shall be adjusted as provided in this Section

with its general evaluation of the annual performance of the Company&#146;s senior executive officers,

performance, and in any event comparable to compensation generally provided to other chief
executive officers of publicly traded companies that are comparable to the Company. If desired by
the Compensation Committee, the Company may retain a reputable compensation consultant to assist
the Compensation Committee in identifying similarly situated companies and to make recommendations
regarding the structure and amount of the cash bonus plan. If this Second Amended Agreement is
terminated in the middle of a Term Year, Executive shall receive a cash bonus for services rendered

federal, state or local statute or common law and regardless of the identities of any other
defendants) that in any way relates to or arises out of the employment relationship established
herein or the termination thereof (a &#147;<U>Dispute</U>&#148;), then arbitration will be used to settle
such Dispute. Because arbitration is generally faster and less expensive than other procedures for
resolving disputes, both Executive and the Company agree that the arbitration procedure set forth
below will be their exclusive remedy and waive any right to seek legal relief in any other form.
In the event that a Dispute involves a claim which either Executive or the Company seeks to assert
against a third party, the assertion of such claim against such third party in a court or other
tribunal shall not relieve Executive and the Company from their respective obligations to resolve
the Dispute between them by arbitration under Section&nbsp;8. The parties further agree that
arbitration shall be their exclusive remedy in the event of any Dispute which involves any third
party (including any officer, director or agent of the Company or an affiliate of the Company)
provided that such third party consents to participate in and be bound by such arbitration. The
only exception to the preceding provisions of Section&nbsp;8.1 is that the Company may seek provisional
relief from any court having jurisdiction in the event of an alleged breach by Executive of
Sections&nbsp;7.1 or 7.2 or any other provision of this Second Amended Agreement pending a final
determination by arbitration, in the event of any claim that would be rendered ineffectual without
provisional relief and Executive may seek such provisional relief, pending a final determination by
arbitration, in the event of any claim that would be rendered ineffectual without provisional
relief. The arbitration will be conducted in accordance with the employment arbitration procedures
of the American Arbitration Association (&#147;<U>AAA</U>&#148;), except as modified in this Second Amended
