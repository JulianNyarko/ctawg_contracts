equity compensation in respect of 2012 in accordance with the provisions of Section 3(c) of the
Employment Agreement (the &#147;<B><I>2012 Equity Grant</I></B>&#148;). Such grant has a target grant value (&#147;<B><I>EIP Target</I></B>&#148;)
of 350% of your annual base salary as in effect on the date hereof (which annual base salary is
$1,000,000), which EIP Target is satisfied in the following manner: (i)&nbsp;50% of the EIP Target
amount is satisfied in the form of time-based restricted stock; (ii)&nbsp;25% of the EIP Target amount
is satisfied in the form of nonqualified stock options (with an exercise price equal to the fair
market value of the Company&#146;s common stock on the date of grant); and (iii)&nbsp;25% of the EIP Target
amount is satisfied in the form of performance shares tied to the performance of the Company. You
agree that the performance goals applicable to the performance shares described in clause (iii)&nbsp;of
the preceding sentence shall be determined in accordance with Exhibit&nbsp;A to the Employment
Agreement, with 50% of the award vesting based upon annual cash earnings results (which cash
earnings goal shall be the same as is applicable to the Company&#146;s senior management team under the
annual bonus plan for 2013) and with the remaining 50% vesting based on the TSR results relative to
the S&P 500 as set forth in such Exhibit&nbsp;A. Subject to the effectiveness of the Release, (x)&nbsp;the
portions of the 2012 Equity Grant which were scheduled to vest solely based on continued employment
with the Company will become fully vested effective on the fifth (5<sup>th</sup>) business day
after the date the Release becomes irrevocable, and (y)&nbsp;the portions of the 2012 Equity Grant which
were scheduled to vest based on attainment of performance goals will remain outstanding and will
vest or be forfeited based upon the attainment of the applicable performance goals. With respect
to stock options which become vested pursuant to the preceding sentence, you will have until the
fourth anniversary of the Retirement Date to exercise such options. If you fail to execute the
Release prior to the deadline described in Section&nbsp;4 or revoke the Release, the 2012 Equity Grant
will be immediately terminated.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(b)&nbsp;<I>Other New Agreement Awards</I>. On the fifth (5<sup>th</sup>) business day after the date the
Release becomes irrevocable, all New Agreement Awards (as defined in the Employment Agreement)
other than the 2012 Equity Grant (all New Agreement Awards other than the 2012 Equity Grant
together referred to herein as the &#147;<B><I>Other New Agreement Awards</I></B>&#148;) shall be subject to the following
treatment: (i)&nbsp;the Other New Agreement Awards which were scheduled to vest based on continued
employment with the Company will become fully vested (such vesting to be effective on the fifth
(5<sup>th</sup>) business day after the date the Release becomes irrevocable); and (ii)&nbsp;the Other
New Agreement Awards which were scheduled to vest based on attainment of performance goals will
remain outstanding and will vest or be forfeited based upon the attainment of the applicable
performance goals. With respect to Other New Agreement Awards which are stock options and which
become vested pursuant to the preceding sentence, you will have until the fourth anniversary of the
Retirement Date to exercise such options (or, if earlier, until the expiration of the term of such
options). If you fail to execute the Release prior to the deadline described in Section&nbsp;4 or
revoke the Release, the treatment of the Other New Agreement Awards set forth herein shall not
apply and such Other New Agreement Awards will be treated in accordance with their existing terms.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(c)&nbsp;<I>Other Equity Awards</I>. Each other equity or equity-based award held by you which is not a
2012 Equity Grant or an Other New Agreement Award will be treated in accordance with its existing
terms; provided that any such award which is unvested on the Retirement Date but was scheduled to
vest prior to January&nbsp;1, 2013 based on your continued employment through such date shall become
fully vested on the fifth (5<sup>th</sup>) business day after the date the Release becomes
irrevocable. If you fail to execute the Release prior to the deadline described in Section&nbsp;4 or
revoke the Release, the treatment set forth herein shall not apply and such awards will be treated
in accordance with their existing terms.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(d)&nbsp;<I>Tax Withholding</I>. Unless otherwise agreed between you and the Company at least five (5)
business days prior to the date upon which tax withholding is due with respect to awards (other
than stock options) which vest pursuant to the operation of this Section&nbsp;2.2, the tax withholding
obligations with respect to such awards shall be satisfied by withholding a number of shares with a
fair market value as of the applicable date equal to such withholding obligations. Tax withholding
with respect to the exercise of stock options shall continue to be governed by the terms of the
applicable plan and option agreement.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%"><B>2.3 Employee Welfare and </B><B>401(k)</B><B> Benefits. </B>Upon the Retirement Date, you shall cease to be an
active participant in all Company benefit plans. Following the Retirement Date, the Company shall

which you participate as in effect immediately prior to the Retirement Date in accordance with the
terms of such benefit plans, including accrued benefits under the Company&#146;s 401(k) (the &#147;<B><I>401(k)
Plan</I></B>&#148;), which shall be paid to you in accordance with the terms of the 401(k) Plan.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%"><B>2.4 Business Expense Reimbursement. </B>The Company shall reimburse you for all reasonable
travel, entertainment or other expenses incurred by you prior to the Retirement Date, in accordance

retirement and ceasing to be an employee of the Company, you shall not be entitled to receive from
the Company or an affiliate (i)&nbsp;any severance pay or severance benefits; or (ii)&nbsp;any
post-termination welfare benefits (other than health care continuation coverage that you may be
entitled to elect pursuant to COBRA, it being agreed that the Company shall not be required to
reimburse you for any premium payments in respect of such COBRA coverage). Your participation in
all Company perquisites shall cease as of the Retirement Date.

Employment Agreement and the non-solicitation covenant set forth in Section 8(b) of the Employment
Agreement shall each be extended and shall apply to you until December&nbsp;31, 2013. You agree that,
following the Retirement Date, you shall comply with the Company&#146;s reasonable requests for
cooperation with respect to matters in which you were involved or with respect to which you have
relevant knowledge.
