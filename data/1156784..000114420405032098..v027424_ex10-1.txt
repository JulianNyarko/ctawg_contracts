      2.    BUYER'S REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES.

      Each Buyer represents and warrants, severally and not jointly, that:

            (a)  Investment  Purpose.  Each Buyer is acquiring  the  Convertible
Debentures  and,  upon  conversion  of  Convertible  Debentures,  the Buyer will
acquire the Conversion Shares then issuable,  for its own account for investment
only and not with a view towards,  or for resale in connection  with, the public
sale or distribution  thereof,  except pursuant to sales  registered or exempted
under the Securities Act; provided,  however, that by making the representations
herein, such Buyer reserves the right to dispose of the Conversion Shares at any
time in  accordance  with or pursuant  to an  effective  registration  statement
covering such Conversion  Shares or an available  exemption under the Securities
Act.


                                       2
<PAGE>

            (b)  Accredited  Investor  Status.  Each  Buyer  is  an  "Accredited
Investor" as that term is defined in Rule 501(a)(3) of Regulation D.

            (c)  Reliance  on  Exemptions.   Each  Buyer  understands  that  the
Convertible  Debentures are being offered and sold to it in reliance on specific
exemptions from the registration requirements of United States federal and state
securities  laws and that the  Company  is  relying  in part  upon the truth and
accuracy of, and such Buyer's compliance with, the representations,  warranties,
agreements, acknowledgments and understandings of such Buyer set forth herein in
order to determine the  availability  of such  exemptions and the eligibility of
such Buyer to acquire such securities.

            (d)  Information.  Each  Buyer  and its  advisors  (and his or,  its
counsel),  if any,  have  been  furnished  with all  materials  relating  to the
business,  finances  and  operations  of the Company and  information  he deemed
material to making an informed investment decision regarding his purchase of the
Convertible  Debentures and the Conversion Shares,  which have been requested by
such  Buyer.  Each  Buyer  and its  advisors,  if any,  have been  afforded  the
opportunity  to ask  questions of the Company and its  management.  Neither such
inquiries nor any other due diligence  investigations conducted by such Buyer or
its advisors,  if any, or its representatives shall modify, amend or affect such
Buyer's right to rely on the Company's  representations and warranties contained
in  Section  3  below.  Each  Buyer  understands  that  its  investment  in  the
Convertible Debentures and the Conversion Shares involves a high degree of risk.
Each Buyer is in a position regarding the Company, which, based upon employment,
family relationship or economic bargaining power, enabled and enables such Buyer
to obtain information from the Company in order to evaluate the merits and risks
of this investment. Each Buyer has sought such accounting, legal and tax advice,
as it has  considered  necessary to make an informed  investment  decision  with
respect to its  acquisition  of the  Convertible  Debenture  and the  Conversion
Shares.

            (e) No Governmental  Review.  Each Buyer  understands that no United
States federal or state agency or any other  government or  governmental  agency
has  passed on or made any  recommendation  or  endorsement  of the  Convertible
Debentures  or the  Conversion  Shares,  or the fairness or  suitability  of the
investment in the Convertible Debentures or the Conversion Shares, nor have such
authorities  passed  upon  or  endorsed  the  merits  of  the  offering  of  the
Convertible Debentures or the Conversion Shares.

            (f)  Transfer  or Resale.  Each  Buyer  understands  that  except as
provided in the Investor  Registration  Rights  Agreement:  (i) the  Convertible
Debentures have not been and are not being  registered  under the Securities Act
or any state securities laws, and may not be offered for sale, sold, assigned or
transferred  unless (A) subsequently  registered  thereunder,  or (B) such Buyer
shall have  delivered  to the  Company an opinion  of  counsel,  in a  generally
acceptable  form,  to the effect that such  securities  to be sold,  assigned or
transferred may be sold,  assigned or transferred  pursuant to an exemption from
such  registration  requirements;  (ii)  any  sale  of such  securities  made in
reliance  on Rule 144 under the  Securities  Act (or a successor  rule  thereto)
("Rule  144")  may be made  only in  accordance  with the  terms of Rule 144 and
further,  if Rule 144 is not  applicable,  any resale of such  securities  under
circumstances  in which the seller (or the person through whom the sale is made)
may be deemed to be an  underwriter  (as that term is defined in the  Securities
Act) may require  compliance  with some other exemption under the Securities Act
or the rules and  regulations  of the SEC  thereunder;  and  (iii)  neither  the
Company nor any other person is under any obligation to register such securities
under the  Securities  Act or any state  securities  laws or to comply  with the
terms and conditions of any exemption thereunder. The Company reserves the right
to place stop transfer  instructions against the shares and certificates for the
Conversion Shares.


                                       3
<PAGE>

            (g) Legends.  Each Buyer  understands that the certificates or other
instruments representing the Convertible Debentures and or the Conversion Shares
shall bear a restrictive  legend in substantially the following form (and a stop
transfer order may be placed against transfer of such stock certificates):

         THE SECURITIES  REPRESENTED BY THIS  CERTIFICATE HAVE NOT BEEN
         REGISTERED  UNDER THE SECURITIES  ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED,  OR
         APPLICABLE  STATE  SECURITIES  LAWS. THE SECURITIES  HAVE BEEN
         ACQUIRED  SOLELY FOR  INVESTMENT  PURPOSES AND NOT WITH A VIEW
         TOWARD  RESALE  AND  MAY  NOT  BE  OFFERED  FOR  SALE,   SOLD,
         TRANSFERRED  OR  ASSIGNED  IN  THE  ABSENCE  OF  AN  EFFECTIVE
         REGISTRATION STATEMENT FOR THE SECURITIES UNDER THE SECURITIES
         ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED,  OR APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES LAWS,
         OR AN OPINION OF COUNSEL, IN A GENERALLY ACCEPTABLE FORM, THAT
         REGISTRATION  IS NOT  REQUIRED  UNDER  SAID ACT OR  APPLICABLE
         STATE SECURITIES LAWS.

The  legend set forth  above  shall be removed  and the  Company  within two (2)
business days shall issue a certificate without such legend to the holder of the
Conversion  Shares upon which it is stamped,  if, unless  otherwise  required by
state securities laws, (i) in connection with a sale  transaction,  provided the
Conversion  Shares are registered under the Securities Act or (ii) in connection
with a sale transaction,  after such holder provides the Company with an opinion
of counsel,  which opinion shall be in form,  substance and scope  customary for
opinions  of counsel in  comparable  transactions,  to the effect  that a public
sale,  assignment  or  transfer  of the  Conversion  Shares may be made  without
registration under the Securities Act.

            (h)  Authorization,  Enforcement.  This  Agreement has been duly and
validly  authorized,  executed  and  delivered  on behalf of such Buyer and is a
valid and binding  agreement of such Buyer  enforceable  in accordance  with its
terms,  except as such  enforceability  may be limited by general  principles of
equity  or  applicable  bankruptcy,  insolvency,   reorganization,   moratorium,
liquidation  and other  similar laws  relating to, or affecting  generally,  the
enforcement of applicable creditors' rights and remedies.

            (j) Due Formation of Corporate and Other Buyers.  If the Buyer(s) is
a  corporation,  trust,  partnership  or other entity that is not an  individual
person, it has been formed and validly exists and has not been organized for the
specific purpose of purchasing the Convertible  Debentures and is not prohibited
from doing so.

            (k) No Legal Advice From the Company. Each Buyer acknowledges,  that
it  had  the   opportunity  to  review  this  Agreement  and  the   transactions
contemplated  by this Agreement with his or its own legal counsel and investment
and tax advisors.  Each Buyer is relying solely on such counsel and advisors and
not  on  any  statements  or  representations  of  the  Company  or  any  of its
representatives  or agents for legal,  tax or investment  advice with respect to
this  investment,  the  transactions  contemplated  by  this  Agreement  or  the
securities laws of any jurisdiction.

foreign corporation to do business and is in good standing in every jurisdiction
in which the nature of the  business  conducted  by it makes such  qualification

subsidiaries taken as a whole.

            (b) Authorization,  Enforcement,  Compliance with Other Instruments.
(i) The Company has the  requisite  corporate  power and authority to enter into

and to issue the Convertible  Debenture and the Conversion  Shares in accordance

affecting  generally,  the  enforcement of creditors'  rights and remedies.  The
authorized  officer of the Company executing the Transaction  Documents knows of
no reason why the Company  cannot file the  registration  statement  as required
under the Investor Registration Rights Agreement or perform any of the Company's
other obligations under such documents.

Instructions to its transfer agent irrevocably  appointing David Gonzalez,  Esq.
as the Company's agent for purpose of having certificates issued,  registered in
the name of the Buyer(s) or its respective nominee(s), for the Conversion Shares
representing  such amounts of  Convertible  Debentures as specified from time to
time  by the  Buyer(s)  to  the  Company  upon  conversion  of  the  Convertible
Debentures, for interest owed pursuant to the Convertible Debenture, and for any
and all Liquidated Damages (as this term is defined in the Investor Registration
Rights  Agreement).  David  Gonzalez,  Esq.  shall  be paid a cash  fee of Fifty
Dollars ($50) for every occasion they act pursuant to the  Irrevocable  Transfer
Agent Instructions.  The Company shall not change its transfer agent without the
express written  consent of the Buyer(s),  which may be withheld by the Buyer(s)
in its sole discretion. Prior to registration of the Conversion Shares under the
Securities  Act,  all  such  certificates  shall  bear  the  restrictive  legend
specified  in Section  2(g) of this  Agreement.  The  Company  warrants  that no
instruction other than the Irrevocable  Transfer Agent Instructions  referred to
in this Section 5, and stop transfer instructions to give effect to Section 2(g)
hereof  (in the case of the  Conversion  Shares  prior to  registration  of such
shares  under the  Securities  Act) will be given by the Company to its transfer
agent and that the Conversion  Shares shall otherwise be freely  transferable on
the books and  records  of the  Company as and to the  extent  provided  in this
Agreement  and the  Investor  Registration  Rights  Agreement.  Nothing  in this

comply with all applicable  securities laws upon resale of Conversion Shares. If

substance  customary for opinions of counsel in comparable  transactions  to the
effect that  registration  of a resale by the Buyer(s) of any of the  Conversion
Shares is not required  under the  Securities  Act, the Company shall within two
(2) business days instruct its transfer agent to issue one or more  certificates
in such name and in such  denominations  as specified by the Buyer.  The Company
acknowledges  that  a  breach  by it of its  obligations  hereunder  will  cause
irreparable  harm to the  Buyer by  vitiating  the  intent  and  purpose  of the
transaction contemplated hereby. Accordingly,  the Company acknowledges that the
remedy  at law for a breach  of its  obligations  under  this  Section 5 will be
inadequate  and  agrees,  in the event of a breach or  threatened  breach by the
Company  of the  provisions  of this  Section  5,  that  the  Buyer(s)  shall be
entitled,  in  addition  to  all  other  available  remedies,  to an  injunction
restraining any breach and requiring  immediate  issuance and transfer,  without
the necessity of showing  economic  loss and without any bond or other  security
being required.

Company and all of its officers,  directors,  employees  and agents  (including,
without   limitation,   those  retained  in  connection  with  the  transactions
contemplated by this Agreement)  (collectively,  the "Company Indemnitees") from
and against any and all Indemnified  Liabilities  incurred by the Indemnitees or
any of  them  as a  result  of,  or  arising  out  of,  or  relating  to (a) any
misrepresentation  or  breach  of any  representation  or  warranty  made by the
Buyer(s)  in this  Agreement,  instrument  or  document  contemplated  hereby or
thereby  executed by the Buyer,  (b) any breach of any  covenant,  agreement  or
obligation  of  the  Buyer(s)   contained  in  this   Agreement,   the  Investor
Registration  Rights Agreement or any other certificate,  instrument or document
contemplated  hereby  or  thereby  executed  by the  Buyer,  or (c) any cause of
action,  suit or claim brought or made against such Company  Indemnitee based on
material  misrepresentations  or due to a material  breach and arising out of or
resulting  from the  execution,  delivery,  performance  or  enforcement of this
Agreement,  the Investor  Registration Rights Agreement or any other instrument,
document or agreement  executed pursuant hereto by any of the parties hereto. To
the extent that the foregoing undertaking by each Buyer may be unenforceable for
any reason,  each Buyer shall make the maximum  contribution  to the payment and
satisfaction of each of the Indemnified Liabilities,  which is permissible under
applicable law.

            (b)  Counterparts.  This  Agreement  may be  executed in two or more
identical  counterparts,  all of  which  shall  be  considered  one and the same
agreement and shall become effective when  counterparts have been signed by each
party and  delivered  to the other  party.  In the event any  signature  page is
delivered  by  facsimile  transmission,  the party  using such means of delivery
shall  cause  four  (4)  additional  original  executed  signature  pages  to be
physically  delivered to the other party  within five (5) days of the  execution

invalid   or   unenforceable   in   any   jurisdiction,   such   invalidity   or
unenforceability  shall  not  affect  the  validity  or  enforceability  of  the
remainder  of  this   Agreement  in  that   jurisdiction   or  the  validity  or
enforceability of any provision of this Agreement in any other jurisdiction.

contain  the entire  understanding  of the parties  with  respect to the matters
covered  herein and therein  and,  except as  specifically  set forth  herein or
therein,  neither the Company nor any Buyer makes any representation,  warranty,
covenant or  undertaking  with  respect to such  matters.  No  provision of this
Agreement may be waived or amended other than by an instrument in writing signed

            (l)  Termination.  In the  event  that the  Closing  shall  not have
occurred with respect to the Buyers on or before five (5) business days from the
date  hereof  due to the  Company's  or  the  Buyer's  failure  to  satisfy  the
conditions  set forth in Sections 6 and 7 above (and the  non-breaching  party's
failure to waive such unsatisfied  condition(s)),  the non-breaching party shall
have the option to terminate this Agreement with respect to such breaching party
at the close of  business  on such date  without  liability  of any party to any
other party;  provided,  however,  that if this  Agreement is  terminated by the
Company  pursuant to this Section 9(l),  the Company  shall remain  obligated to
reimburse  the  Buyer(s)  for  the  fees  and  expenses  of  Yorkville  Advisors
Management, LLC described in Section 4(g) above.
