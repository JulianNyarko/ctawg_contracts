<P style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:12.667px; text-indent:48px" align=justify><B>SERIES OF NOTES.</B> &nbsp;This Note is one of a duly authorized issue of Notes of the Corporation designated as its Series B 5% Subordinated Notes due 2022 (herein called the &#147;Notes&#148;), limited in aggregate principal amount to $6,020,000, all of substantially identical terms and provisions except for numbers, dates of issue and principal amount. &nbsp;Notes may only be issued in principal amounts of not less than $50,000 (subject to wavier by the Corporation in its sole discretion) which are an integer multiple of $10,000.<B> </B></P>
<P style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:12.667px; text-indent:48px" align=justify><B>PRIORITY; NO COLLATERAL OR GUARANTEE.</B> The payment of the indebtedness evidenced by the Notes is not secured by the pledge of any assets, any guarantee or insurance, a sinking fund or any other security or collateral, and the rights of the Holder shall be the same as the rights of any general unsecured creditor of the Corporation. The Corporation reserves the right to issue indebtedness senior to, or on par with, the indebtedness evidenced by the Notes, including without limitation secured indebtedness. &nbsp;Upon the distribution of assets of the Corporation because of distribution, winding up, liquidation, bankruptcy or reorganization, the payment of principal and interest on the Notes is subordinated to the prior payment in full of all senior indebtedness of the Corporation, but the obligation of the Corporation to make payment of principal and interest on the Notes is not otherwise affected.</P>
<P style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:12.667px; text-indent:48px" align=justify><B>PAYMENTS MAY BE SUBJECT TO REGULATORY RESTRICTIONS. </B>Payments of interest and principal under this Note may be subject to restrictions or prohibited due to regulatory action or other restrictions imposed by government agencies and applicable law, including but not limited to regulatory orders issued by the Federal Reserve and regulatory orders issued by the FDIC or the South Carolina State Board of Financial Institutions limiting the payment of dividends to the Corporation by Greer State Bank (&#147;Regulatory Action&#148;). <B>Notwithstanding any other provisions of the Notes, delay of any payment under the Notes prior to the Maturity Date due to Regulatory Action shall not constitute a default under, or breach of, the terms of the Notes.</B> &nbsp;</P>
<P style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:12.667px; text-indent:48px" align=justify><B>TRANSFER.</B> &nbsp;Subject to the restrictions on transfer set forth below, the transfer of this Note may be registered in the Corporation's register for the Notes (the &quot;Note Register&quot;), upon surrender of this Note for registration of transfer at the Corporation Office, accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Corporation duly executed by the Holder hereof or such Holder&#146;s attorney duly author&shy;ized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Notes, of authorized denominations and for the same aggregate principal amount, will be issued to the designated trans&shy;feree or transferees. No service charge shall be made for any such registra&shy;tion of transfer or exchange, but the Corporation may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith. The Corporation shall not have any obligations to a transferee of this Note unless and until it has been duly transferred in accordance with the terms hereof and the transfer has been registered by the Corporation on the Note Register.</P>
<P style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:12.667px; text-indent:48px" align=justify><B>RESTRICTIONS ON TRANSFER.</B> THE SALE OF THIS NOTE HAS NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OR ANY STATE SECURITIES LAW IN RELIANCE UPON EXEMPTIONS THEREFROM. &nbsp;THE HOLDER MUST HOLD THIS NOTE UNTIL MATURITY UNLESS THE SALE OR OTHER TRANSFER THEREOF IS SUBSEQUENTLY REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT AND ANY APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES LAWS OR EXEMPTIONS FROM SUCH REGISTRATION ARE AVAILABLE, PROVIDED THAT THE CORPORATION MAY REQUIRE AN OPINION OF LEGAL COUNSEL ACCEPTABLE TO THE CORPORATION THAT REGISTRATION IS NOT REQUIRED. THE HOLDER FURTHER UNDERSTANDS THAT THE CORPORATION IS UNDER NO OBLIGATION TO REGISTER THE SECURITIES ON THE HOLDER&#146;S BEHALF OR TO ASSIST THE HOLDER IN COMPLYING WITH ANY EXEMPTION FROM REGISTRATION.</P>
<P style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:12.667px; text-indent:48px" align=justify><B>COMPUTATION OF INTEREST.</B> &nbsp;Interest on this Note shall be computed on the basis of a 365-day year. In the event that any interest payment is not paid when due for any reason (including without limitation any Regulatory Action), interest shall compound at the end of each calendar year quarter. &nbsp;In the event that the rate of interest payable under this Note shall be higher than the maximum rate of interest permitted by applicable law, then the rate of interest payable under this Note shall be automatically adjusted to be the highest rate of interest permitted by applicable law.</P>

<P style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:12.667px; text-indent:48px" align=justify>Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, the Corporation shall make available at the Corporation Office a list of all Holders of the Notes so that such Holders can communicate with one another for the purpose of taking protective action.</P>
