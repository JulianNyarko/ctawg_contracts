with the Internal Revenue Service (the &#147;<U>IRS</U>&#148;) under Section&nbsp;83(b) of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder in the form of <U>Exhibit B</U> attached hereto (the &#147;<U>83(b) Election</U>&#148;). The Employee
understands that under applicable law such election must be filed with the IRS no later than thirty (30)&nbsp;days after the date of purchase of Class&nbsp;A Shares to be effective. If the Employee files an effective 83(b) Election, the excess of
the fair market value of the Class&nbsp;A Shares (which the IRS may assert is different from the Fair Market Value determined by the parties) covered by such election over the amount paid by the Employee for the shares shall be treated as ordinary
income received by the Employee, and the Company or one of its Subsidiaries shall withhold from Employee&#146;s compensation any amounts required to be withheld under applicable law. If the Employee does not file an 83(b) Election, future
appreciation on the Class&nbsp;A Shares will generally be taxable as ordinary income at the time or times when the Company&#146;s repurchase rights with respect to such Class&nbsp;A Shares (as set forth in this Agreement) lapse. The foregoing is
merely a brief summary of complex tax laws and regulations, and therefore the Employee is advised to consult with his own tax advisors regarding his purchase and holding of Class&nbsp;A Shares. </FONT></TD></TR></TABLE> <P
