one-third increments on each of &#091;insert dates that are first, second and
third anniversary date of approval of award by Compensation Committee&#093;
(each a &#147;Vesting Date&#148;); provided, however, that if the Participant&#146;s Date
of Termination occurs by reason of death, Disability or Retirement, this
Option shall vest and become immediately exercisable on the Participant&#146;s
Date of Termination. This Option shall also vest and become exercisable
as described in Paragraph&nbsp;11 of this Agreement. Except as provided in the
foregoing provisions of this Paragraph&nbsp;3, any portion of the Option which
is not vested upon the Participant&#146;s Date of Termination shall be
forfeited on such date. The Option shall also be forfeited in accordance
with Paragraph&nbsp;10. For purposes of this Agreement, the Participant&#146;s
&#147;Date of Termination&#148; shall be the date on which he both ceases to be an
employee of the Trust and the Subsidiaries and ceases to perform material
services for the Trust and the Subsidiaries, regardless of the reason for
the cessation; provided that a &#147;Date of Termination&#148; shall not be
considered to have occurred during the period in which the reason for the
cessation of services is a leave of absence approved by the Trust or the
Subsidiary which was the recipient of the Participant&#146;s services. The
Participant shall be considered to have a &#147;Disability&#148; for purposes of
this Agreement during the period in which he is unable, by reason of a
medically determinable physical or mental impairment, to engage in the
material and substantial duties of his regular occupation, which condition
is expected to be permanent. &#147;Retirement&#148; of a Participant shall mean the
occurrence of a Participant&#146;s Date of Termination after providing at least
five years of service to the Trust or the Subsidiaries and attaining age
60.</TD>
