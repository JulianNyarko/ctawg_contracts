</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Indemnification Agreement (&#147;Agreement&#148;) is made as of <U>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</U> <U>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</U>, 20<U>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</U> by and between
The Advisory Board Company, a Delaware corporation (the &#147;Company&#148;), and <U>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</U><U>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</U>
(&#147;Indemnitee&#148;). This Agreement supersedes and replaces any and all previous agreements between the
Company and Indemnitee covering the subject matter of this Agreement.
</DIV>

<DIV align="center" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 18pt"><B>RECITALS</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, highly competent persons have become more reluctant to serve publicly-held
corporations as directors or officers or in other capacities unless they are provided with adequate
protection through insurance or adequate indemnification against inordinate risks of claims and
actions against them arising out of their service to and activities on behalf of the corporation;
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company (the &#147;Board&#148;) has determined that, in order to
attract and retain qualified individuals, the Company will attempt to maintain on an ongoing basis,
at its sole expense, liability insurance to protect persons serving the Company and its
subsidiaries from certain liabilities. Although the furnishing of such insurance has been a
customary and widespread practice among United States-based corporations and other business
enterprises, the Company believes that, given current market conditions and trends, such insurance
may be available to it in the future only at higher premiums and with more exclusions. At the same
time, directors, officers, and other persons in service to corporations or business enterprises are
being increasingly subjected to expensive and time-consuming litigation relating to, among other
things, matters that traditionally would have been brought only against the Company or business
enterprise itself. The Bylaws of the Company (the &#147;By-laws&#148;) and the Certificate of Incorporation
of the Company (the &#147;Certificate of Incorporation&#148;) require indemnification of the officers and
directors of the Company. Indemnitee may also be entitled to indemnification pursuant to the
General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the &#147;DGCL&#148;). The Bylaws, Certificate of
Incorporation and the DGCL expressly provide that the indemnification provisions set forth therein
are not exclusive, and thereby contemplate that contracts may be entered into between the Company
and members of the board of directors, officers and other persons with respect to indemnification;
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, the uncertainties relating to such insurance and to indemnification have increased
the difficulty of attracting and retaining such persons;
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, the Board has determined that the increased difficulty in attracting and retaining
such persons is detrimental to the best interests of the Company and its stockholders and that the
Company should act to assure such persons that there will be increased certainty of such protection
in the future;
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, it is reasonable, prudent and necessary for the Company contractually to obligate
itself to indemnify, and to advance expenses on behalf of, such persons to the fullest

free from undue concern that they will not be so indemnified;
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, this Agreement is a supplement to and in furtherance of the Bylaws and the
Certificate of Incorporation and any resolutions adopted pursuant thereto, and shall not be deemed
a substitute therefor, nor to diminish or abrogate any rights of Indemnitee thereunder;
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, Indemnitee does not regard the protection available under the Bylaws and the
Certificate of Incorporation and insurance as adequate in the present circumstances, and may not be
willing to serve as an officer or director without adequate protection, and the Company desires
Indemnitee to serve in such capacity. Indemnitee is willing to serve, continue to serve and to
take on additional service for or on behalf of the Company on the condition that he be so
indemnified; and

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section&nbsp;1. <U>Services to the Company.</U> Indemnitee agrees to serve and/or continue to
serve as a director, officer, employee and/or other agent of the Company. Indemnitee may at any
time and for any reason resign from such position (subject to any other contractual obligation or
any obligation imposed by operation of law), in which event the Company shall have no obligation
under this Agreement to continue Indemnitee in such position. This Agreement shall not be deemed
an employment contract between the Company (or any of its subsidiaries or any Enterprise) and
Indemnitee. Indemnitee specifically acknowledges that Indemnitee&#146;s employment with the Company (or
any of its subsidiaries or any Enterprise), if any, is at will, and the Indemnitee may be
discharged at any time for any reason, with or without cause, except as may be otherwise provided
in any written employment contract between Indemnitee and the Company (or any of its subsidiaries
or any Enterprise), other applicable formal severance policies duly adopted by the Board, or, with
respect to service as a director or officer of the Company, by the Certificate of Incorporation,
the Company&#146;s By-laws, and the DGCL. The foregoing notwithstanding, this Agreement shall continue
in force after Indemnitee has ceased to serve as a director, officer and/or other agent of the
Company, as provided in Section&nbsp;16 hereof.

determination, if required by applicable law, with respect to Indemnitee&#146;s entitlement thereto
shall be made in the specific case: (i)&nbsp;if a Change in Control shall have occurred, by Independent
Counsel in a written opinion to the Board, a copy of which shall be delivered to Indemnitee; or
(ii)&nbsp;if a Change in Control shall not have occurred, (A)&nbsp;by a majority vote of the Disinterested
Directors, even though less than a quorum of the Board, (B)&nbsp;by a committee of Disinterested
Directors designated by a majority vote of the Disinterested Directors, even though less than a
quorum of the Board, (C)&nbsp;if there are no such Disinterested Directors or, if such Disinterested
Directors so direct, by Independent Counsel in a written opinion to the Board, a copy of which
shall be delivered to Indemnitee or (D)&nbsp;if so directed by the Board, by the stockholders of the
Company; and, if it is so determined that Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification, payment to
Indemnitee shall be made within ten (10)&nbsp;days after such determination. Indemnitee shall cooperate
with the person, persons or entity making such determination with respect to Indemnitee&#146;s
entitlement to indemnification, including providing to such person, persons or entity upon
reasonable advance request any documentation or information which is not privileged or otherwise
protected from disclosure and which is reasonably available to Indemnitee and reasonably necessary
to such determination. Any costs or Expenses (including attorneys&#146; fees and disbursements)
incurred by Indemnitee in so cooperating with the person, persons or entity making such
determination shall be borne by the Company (irrespective of the determination as to Indemnitee&#146;s
entitlement to indemnification) and the Company hereby indemnifies and agrees to hold Indemnitee
harmless therefrom. The Company promptly will advise Indemnitee in writing with respect to any
determination that Indemnitee is or is not entitled to indemnification, including a description of
any reason or basis for which indemnification has been denied.

provided in this Section&nbsp;12(b). If a Change in Control shall not have occurred, the Independent
Counsel shall be selected by the Board, and the Company shall give written notice to Indemnitee
advising him of the identity of the Independent Counsel so selected. If a Change in Control shall
have occurred, the Independent Counsel shall be selected by Indemnitee (unless Indemnitee shall
request that such selection be made by the Board, in which event the preceding sentence shall
apply), and Indemnitee shall give written notice to the Company advising it of the identity of the
Independent Counsel so selected. In either event, Indemnitee or the Company, as the case may be,

Independent Counsel so selected does not meet the requirements of &#147;Independent Counsel&#148; as defined

basis of such assertion. Absent a proper and timely objection, the person so selected shall act as

Independent Counsel shall have been selected and not objected to, either the Company or Indemnitee

the Company shall, to the fullest extent not prohibited by law, have the burden of proof to
overcome that presumption in connection with the making by any person, persons or entity of any
determination contrary to that presumption. Neither the failure of the Company (including by its
directors or Independent Counsel) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of any
action pursuant to this Agreement that indemnification is proper in the circumstances because
Indemnitee has met the applicable standard of conduct, nor an actual determination by the Company

therefor, the requisite determination of entitlement to indemnification shall, to the fullest

indemnification, absent (i)&nbsp;a misstatement by Indemnitee of a material fact, or an omission of a
material fact necessary to make Indemnitee&#146;s statement not materially misleading, in connection
with the request for indemnification, or (ii)&nbsp;a prohibition of such indemnification under
applicable law; provided, however, that such 60-day period may be extended for a reasonable time,
not to exceed an additional thirty (30)&nbsp;days, if the person, persons or entity making the
determination with respect to entitlement to indemnification in good faith requires such additional
time for the obtaining or evaluating of documentation and/or information relating thereto; and
