Inc. (the &#147;Company&#148;), and its Subsidiaries, by attracting and retaining employees through the use of cash and stock incentives and to encourage ownership in the Company by non-employee members of the Board of Directors of the Company. It
is believed that ownership of Company Stock and the use of cash incentives will stimulate the efforts of those employees upon whose judgment and interests the Employers are and will be dependent for the successful conduct of their business. It is
also believed that Incentive Awards granted to such employees under this Plan will strengthen their desire to remain employed with the Employers and will further the identification of those employees&#146; interests with those of the Company&#146;s
shareholders. Finally, it is believed that Options granted to non-employee members of the Board of Directors of the Company will promote long-term shareholder value and will provide non-employee members of the Board of Directors of the Company with
an incentive to continue as directors of the Company. The Plan is intended to operate in compliance with the provisions of Rule 16b-3. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P> <P
