                              ASSUMPTION AGREEMENT

      ASSUMPTION  AGREEMENT (the "Assumption  Agreement"),  dated as of June 23,
2004,   among  Encompass  Group   Affiliates,   Inc.,  a  Delaware   corporation
("Encompass"),  and  Hy-Tech  Technology  Group,  Inc.,  a Delaware  corporation
("Hy-Tech   Technology"),   and  Hy-Tech  Computer  Systems,  Inc.,  a  Delaware
corporation ("Hy-Tech Computer" and together with Hy-Tech Technology, "HYTT").

                                   BACKGROUND

         A. HYTT is entering into an Agreement with  Encompass,  dated as of the
date hereof (the "Agreement"),  pursuant to which HYTT concurrently  herewith is
refraining from pursuing  certain of rights and licensing  certain of its assets
to Encompass.

         B. In partial  consideration  therefore,  the  Agreement  requires that
Encompass agree to perform, pay or discharge certain liabilities and obligations
of HYTT.

         NOW,  THEREFORE,  for  valuable  consideration,  the  receipt and legal
sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged,  and intending to be legally bound
hereby, the parties hereby agree as follows:

         1. Assumption of Liabilities.  Encompass hereby undertakes, assumes and
agrees to perform,  pay or discharge  in  accordance  with their  terms,  to the
extent  not  heretofore  performed,  paid  or  discharged  and  subject  to  the
limitations  contained  in  this  Assumption  Agreement,   the  liabilities  and
obligations of HYTT  described in Schedule I hereto,  but only to the extent and
in the amounts that such liabilities and obligations are so listed or described.

         2.  Remedies.  The  assumption  by  Encompass  of the  liabilities  and
obligations  set forth in this  Assumption  Agreement  shall not be construed to
defeat,  impair or limit in any way the rights,  claims or remedies of Encompass
under the Agreement.

         3. No Other  Liabilities.  Other than as specifically set forth in this
Assumption Agreement,  Encompass assumes no liability or obligation of any kind,
character or description of HYTT or any other person.

         4.  Governing  Law.  This  Assumption  Agreement  shall be governed and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware.

         5. Binding Agreement.  This Assumption Agreement shall be binding upon,
and shall  inure to the benefit  of, the  successors  and assigns of the parties
hereto.

         6.  Amendments and Waiver.  No  modification,  wavier or termination of
this  Assumption  Agreement  shall be binding unless  executed in writing by the
party to be bound thereby. No waiver of any of the provisions of this Assumption
Agreement  shall be deemed or shall  constitute a waiver of any other  provision
hereof,  nor shall such waiver  constitute a continuing  waiver unless otherwise
expressly provided.

         7.  Severability.  In the event that any  provision of this  Assumption
Agreement   shall   be  held  to  be   unenforceable   for  any   reason,   such
unenforceability shall not affect any other provision hereof.

         8.  Counterparts.  This Assumption  Agreement may be executed in one or
more counterparts,  each of which shall constitute an original, but all of which
together shall be one and the same instrument.
