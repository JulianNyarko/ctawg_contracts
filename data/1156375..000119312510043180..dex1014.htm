<TD ALIGN="left" VALIGN="top"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Pursuant to Section&nbsp;7(e) of the Plan, a new Section&nbsp;7(l) is hereby added to the Plan, as follows: </FONT></TD></TR></TABLE> <P
STYLE="margin-top:6px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">(l) <B><I>Recoupment</I></B>. It shall be a condition of payment of an Award under the Plan that any Participant who holds the position of Executive
Chairman, serves on the Management Team or holds the position of Managing Director (any such person being referred to hereinafter as a &#147;Covered Participant&#148;) agree to the applicability of this Section&nbsp;7(l) to any Award paid to such
Participant under the Plan as a Covered Participant. In the event that a Covered Participant receives a payment pursuant to the Plan and: (1)&nbsp;the payment was predicated upon achieving certain financial results that were subsequently the subject
of a restatement of Company financial statements filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission; and (2)&nbsp;a lower payment would have been made to the Covered Participant based upon the restated financial results, upon the recommendation of
the Compensation Committee, the Board may, in its discretion, require such Covered Participant to repay all or a portion of the difference between the payment received by the Covered Participant and the payment which would have been paid to the
Covered Participant based on the restated financials (such difference being referred to as the &#147;Recoupment Amount&#148;). In order to collect the Recoupment Amount, the Board may require the Covered Participant to forfeit all or a portion of
any unvested restricted stock issued in respect of Awards hereunder, in an amount not to exceed the Recoupment Amount. The Company&#146;s right to require repayment or forfeiture set forth in this Section&nbsp;7(l) shall apply only if the facts
leading to a determination that a restatement is required are discovered within the three (3)&nbsp;fiscal years following the fiscal year with respect to which the Covered Participant is paid an Award hereunder. The Recoupment Amount shall be
determined by the Board in its good faith discretion and without regard to any deferral of Awards hereunder. The Committee may require any Covered Participant to execute an acknowledgement of the applicability of this Section&nbsp;7(l) and an
agreement to comply with its provisions, in such form as the Committee may determine, as a condition to the receipt of any payment under the Plan. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="font-size:12px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px">&nbsp;</P>
