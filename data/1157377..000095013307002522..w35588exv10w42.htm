developed by or on behalf of CEB and offered by CEB through the General Counsel Roundtable in
accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement (the &#147;<U>General Counsel
Collaboration</U>&#148;). CEB has informed ABCO that CEB will be providing the General Counsel
Materials and any other BDP content to ABCO for the purposes of the General Counsel Collaboration,
in each case subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, as an extension of the
so-called &#147;CEB Network,&#148; and CEB hereby represents and warrants to ABCO that CEB&#146;s provision of
General Counsel Materials and any other BDP content for these purposes does not in any way impose
on ABCO any right, obligation, limitation or otherwise that is not expressly provided in this
Agreement or affect any of ABCO&#146;s rights or obligations provided in this Agreement with respect to
the General Counsel Materials.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) <U>Term of General Counsel Collaboration</U>. Unless sooner terminated or extended in

at least thirty (30)&nbsp;days prior to the expiration of the GC Initial Term, or any subsequent GC
Extended Term, to extend the term of the General Counsel Collaboration through February&nbsp;5, 2012 and

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) <U>Grant by CEB to ABCO of Certain Rights</U>. Subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, CEB hereby grants to ABCO a nonexclusive, worldwide license to reproduce, prepare
derivative works based on (subject to <U>Section&nbsp;3.1(h)</U>), and distribute in accordance with
the remainder of this <U>Section&nbsp;3.1(b)</U>, all materials developed by or on behalf of CEB in
connection with the General Counsel Roundtable as part of ABCO&#146;s own BDP membership program to
serve general counsels and/or legal departments of Health Care Provider Companies (the &#147;<U>ABCO
General Counsel Offering</U>&#148;). Such materials developed by or on behalf of CEB include, but are
not limited to, the following: research studies, briefings, watches; meeting/on-site presentations
and scripts; tools, templates, and benchmarks; and all General Counsel Roundtable program materials
posted on CEB&#146;s General Counsel Roundtable website (the latter of which shall be provided through

be entitled to distribute the General Counsel Materials as part of the ABCO General Counsel
Offering, subject to payment of license fees in accordance with <U>Section&nbsp;3.1(d)</U>, on a
&#147;private label basis&#148; (<U>i.e.</U>, under ABCO&#146;s own trademarks, service marks and brands), and
subject to the attribution obligation set forth in <U>Section&nbsp;3.1(e)</U>. Membership of the ABCO
General Counsel Offering that includes access to the General Counsel Materials licensed by ABCO
from CEB pursuant to this Agreement will be an &#147;<U>ABCO General Counsel Membership</U>.&#148;
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, ABCO will not be permitted to grant to
any Entity with an ABCO General Counsel Membership rights to the General Counsel Materials offered
by ABCO in connection with the ABCO General Counsel Offering that are greater or more permissive
than the rights ABCO grants in the ordinary course of its business to members of its other BDP
programs with respect to materials prepared by ABCO, including rights with respect to the
confidentiality, reproduction, and use of such materials.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) <U>Dialogue and Training</U>. CEB will provide to ABCO up to 40 hours of time per
calendar quarter during the GC Term at mutually agreeable times for dialogue with ABCO staff about
research topics and to train ABCO sales and service teams on matters concerning the General Counsel
Roundtable, the General Counsel Materials licensed by ABCO from CEB in connection with the General
Counsel Collaboration, and the ABCO General Counsel Offering. CEB will also make available to ABCO
on a limited basis during the GC Term appropriate researchers of its General Counsel Roundtable to
field specific questions concerning the research supporting the General Counsel Materials that are

the entire Agreement, and if any provision is declared invalid, the remaining provisions will
nevertheless remain in effect, and the invalid provision will be deemed to be amended, but only to
the extent necessary to make the provision valid and enforceable consistent with the Parties&#146;
respective intentions as of the Effective Date.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.5 <U>Entire Agreement</U>. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the
Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, and no amendment or modification of any of the
terms and conditions of this Agreement will be valid unless in writing and executed by both
Parties. Any prior oral or written agreements or understandings with respect to the subject matter
hereof are not considered a part of this Agreement and are superseded hereby effective as of the
Effective Date, including the Non-Competition Agreement, effective as of January&nbsp;1, 1999, among the
Parties and David G. Bradley, as amended.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.6 <U>Governing Law</U>. This Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.7 <U>Dispute Resolution</U>. The Parties will endeavor to settle all disputes by amicable
negotiations. Any claim, dispute, disagreement or controversy that arises among the Parties
(&#147;<U>Disputed Matter</U>&#148;) relating to this Agreement that is not amicably settled will be
referred to and settled by arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association in
accordance with the Expedited Procedures of the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American
Arbitration Association (the &#147;<U>AAA Rules</U>&#148;) by a single arbitrator who is mutually agreeable
to the Parties. If the Parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator, one arbitrator will be
selected in accordance with the AAA Rules. All proceedings in any such arbitration will be
conducted in Washington, D.C. Each Party to such arbitration proceeding will bear its respective
costs, fees and expenses in connection with such arbitration. Upon a final determination by the
arbitrator with respect to the Disputed Matter, the arbitrator will notify the Parties (such notice
being the &#147;<U>Arbitration Order</U>&#148;). Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may
be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. Jurisdiction of such arbitrator will be
exclusive as to disputes among the Parties relating to this Agreement and each of the Parties agree
that this agreement to arbitrate will be specifically enforceable under the laws of the respective
domiciliary jurisdictions of the Parties. Neither of the Parties will have the right to appeal the
Arbitration Order or otherwise to submit a dispute relating to this Agreement to a court of law.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.8 <U>Counterparts</U>. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which will

power, or privilege under this Agreement or under any other document furnished in connection with
or pursuant to this Agreement will impair any such right, power, or privilege or be construed as a
waiver of any default or any acquiescence therein. No single or partial exercise of any such
right, power, or privilege will preclude the further exercise of such right, power, or privilege.
No waiver will be valid against either Party unless made in writing and signed by such Party
against whom enforcement of such waiver is sought and then only to the extent expressly specified
therein.
