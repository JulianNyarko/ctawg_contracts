maximum number of Shares which shall be reserved for sale under the Plan shall be 100,000 Shares. If any option granted under the Plan shall expire or terminate for any reason without having been exercised in full or shall cease for any reason to be
exercisable in whole or in part, the unpurchased Shares subject thereto shall again be available under the Plan. Such reserved Shares shall be either authorized and unissued Shares or Shares which have been reacquired by the Company. If the total
number of Shares which would otherwise be purchased pursuant to options granted hereunder on an Exercise Date exceeds the number of Shares then available under the Plan (after deduction of all Shares for which options have been exercised or are then
outstanding), the Committee shall make a pro rata allocation of the Shares remaining available for option grant in as uniform a manner as shall be practicable and as it shall determine to be equitable and in compliance with the provisions of
Section&nbsp;423 of the Code. In such event, the Committee shall give written notice to each Participant of such reduction of the number of option Shares affected thereby and shall similarly reduce the rate of payroll deductions, if necessary.

any rights with regard to the exercise of an option or to receive Shares under the Plan may be assigned, transferred, pledged or otherwise disposed of in any way by the Participant. Any such attempt at assignment, transfer, pledge or other
disposition shall be without effect, except that the Company may treat such act as an election to withdraw funds in accordance with Section&nbsp;9 hereof. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT
