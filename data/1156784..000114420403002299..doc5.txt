                                    AGREEMENT

                               EXERCISE OF OPTION

2.1 DATE  EXERCISABLE.  The  Options  shall  become  exercisable  by Optionee in
accordance with Section 1.4 above.

2.2 MANNER OF EXERCISE OF OPTIONS AND PAYMENT FOR COMMON STOCK.  The Options may
be exercised by the Optionee,  in whole or in part, by giving  written notice to
the Trust or Trusts whose Option  Shares are subject to such  exercise,  setting
forth the number of Shares with respect to which Options are being exercised, in
the form attached  hereto as Exhibit A. The purchase  price of the Option Shares
upon  exercise  of the  Options by the  Optionee  shall be paid in full in cash,
except as provided in section 2.3 below.

2.3 CASHLESS  EXERCISE.  Optionee may, at its option, in lieu of paying cash for
the Option Shares,  exercise this Option by an exchange, in whole or in part (an
"Option  Exchange"),  by  delivery  of (i) a duly  executed  Notice of  Exercise
electing an Option  Exchange  and (ii) the Option  Agreement  representing  this
Option. In connection with any Option Exchange,  the Optionee shall be deemed to
have paid for the Option Shares an amount equal to the Fair Market Value of each
Option  delivered,  and the Options shall be deemed  exercised for the amount so
paid.  For this purpose,  the Fair Market Value of each Option is the difference
between the Market Value of a Share of Common  Stock and the  Exercise  Price on
the date of  delivery.  Market  Value  shall mean the average of the closing bid
price for a Share of common Stock  during the ten (10)  trading  days  preceding
delivery.  In no event shall the  Optionee be entitled to receive  more than the
total number of Option Shares granted hereunder.

2.4 STOCK  CERTIFICATES.  Promptly after any exercise in whole or in part of the
Options by Optionee,  the Trust or Trusts subject to such exercise shall deliver
to Optionee a certificate or certificates  for the number of Shares with respect
to which the Options were so exercised,  registered in Optionee's  name. In lieu
thereof,  if the certificates  for the Shares are held in escrow,  they shall be
delivered to Optionee by the escrow agent or comparable  party. The certificates
for the Shares shall bear a legend  referring to the  restrictions  set forth in
this Agreement and that the Shares are subject to the Option and Proxy set forth
in this Agreement..

Trust,  on any and all matters,  proposals and  questions,  that may be lawfully
considered  there, and to execute any written consents of Shareholder  which may

as such Trust could do if personally present thereat or if personally  solicited

                                       2

to  execute  such  written  consents.  Each Trust  hereby  revokes  all  proxies

shall lawfully do in voting the Common Stock in accordance  herewith at any such
meeting or adjournment  in respect of all matters,  proposals and questions that
may properly come before the shareholders  for  consideration  and action.  Each
Trust  acknowledges  that  this  proxy  is  coupled  with  an  interest  and  is
irrevocable  with  respect to all Common  Stock owned by such Trust for the term
set forth in the forms of proxy  attached  hereto.  The Gary Trust shall execute
and deliver  the form of  irrevocable  proxy  attached  hereto as  Schedule  B-1
simultaneously  with the  execution  of this  Agreement.  The Susan  Trust shall
execute and deliver the form of irrevocable  proxy attached  hereto as Schedules

shares  subject to the Options  under this  Agreement to which the Options shall
not have been exercised.

                                   SECTION 5
                                   ADJUSTMENTS

5.1 NO EFFECT ON CHANGES IN COMPANY'S  CAPITAL  STRUCTURE.  The existence of the
Options  shall not  affect in any way the right or power of the  Company  or its
shareholders   to  make  or   authorize   any   adjustments,   recapitalization,
reorganization,  or other  changes in the  Company's  capital  structure  or its
business,  or any merger or consolidation of the Company, or any issue of bonds,
debentures,  preferred or  preference  stocks  ahead of or affecting  the Option
Shares,  or the  dissolution  or  liquidation  of the  Company,  or any  sale or
transfer of all or any part of its assets or  business,  or any other  corporate
act or proceeding, whether of a similar character or otherwise.

5.2  ADJUSTMENT  TO OPTION  SHARES.  The Option Shares are subject to adjustment
upon recapitalization,  reclassification, consolidation, merger, reorganization,
stock  dividend,  reverse or forward  stock  split and the like.  If the Company
shall be  reorganized,  consolidated  or merged with another  Company,  Optionee
shall be entitled to receive upon the exercise of the Option the same number and
kind of shares of stock or the same amount of property,  cash or  securities  as
Optionee  would have been  entitled to receive  upon the  happening  of any such
corporate event as if Optionee had been,  immediately  prior to such event,  the
holder of the  number of Shares  covered by the  Option.  If the  Company  shall
declare  any  dividend  or  distribution  after  the date of  execution  of this
Agreement,  the Trust or Trusts  whose  Shares are  subject to the Option  shall
deliver such dividend or distribution to the Optionee along with the certificate
for such shares when the Option is exercised.
