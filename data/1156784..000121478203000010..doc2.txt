     As  an  inducement to, and to obtain the reliance of the Company, except as
set  forth on the Hy-Tech Schedules (as hereinafter defined), Hy-Tech represents
and  warrants  as  follows:

public  authorities  to own all of its properties and assets and to carry on its
business  in  all  material  respects  as  it  is now being conducted, including
qualification to do business as a foreign corporation in the states or countries
in  which  the character and location of the assets owned by it or the nature of
the business transacted by it requires qualification, except where failure to be
so qualified would not have a material adverse effect on its business.  Included
in  the  Hy-Tech  Schedules  are  complete and correct copies of the articles of
incorporation,  and  bylaws  of  Hy-Tech  as  in effect on the date hereof.  The
execution  and  delivery of this Agreement does not, and the consummation of the
transactions  contemplated  hereby will not, violate any provision of Hy-Tech 's
articles  of incorporation or bylaws.  Hy-Tech has taken all actions required by
law,  its articles of incorporation, or otherwise to authorize the execution and
delivery  of this Agreement.  Hy-Tech has full power, authority, and legal right
and  has  taken  all  action required by law, its articles of incorporation, and
otherwise  to  consummate  the  transactions  herein  contemplated.

     Section  1.02     Capitalization.  The authorized capitalization of Hy-Tech

               (c)  Hy-Tech  has filed all state, federal or local income and/or
          franchise tax returns required to be filed by it from inception to the

writ, injunction, decree, award, rule or regulation of any court, arbitrator, or
governmental  agency  or  instrumentality  or  any  circumstance  which  after
reasonable  investigation  would  result  in  the  discovery  of  such  default.

     Section  3.05     Termination.
                       ------------

               (a) This Agreement may be terminated by the board of directors of
          either  the  Company  or Hy-Tech at any time prior to the Closing Date
          if:

                    (i)  there  shall  be  any  actual  or  threatened action or
               proceeding  before any court or any governmental body which shall
               seek  to  restrain,  prohibit,  or  invalidate  the  transactions
               contemplated by this Agreement and which, in the judgment of such
               board  of directors, made in good faith and based upon the advice
               of  its  legal  counsel, makes it inadvisable to proceed with the
               Exchange;  or

                    (ii)  any  of  the  transactions  contemplated  hereby  are
               disapproved  by  any  regulatory  authority  whose  approval  is
               required  to consummate such transactions (which does not include
               the  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission) or in the judgment of
               such  board  of  directors,  made  in good faith and based on the
               advice  of counsel, there is substantial likelihood that any such
               approval  will  not  be  obtained  or  will be obtained only on a
               condition  or conditions which would be unduly burdensome, making
               it  inadvisable  to  proceed  with  the  Exchange.

In  the  event of termination pursuant to this paragraph (a) of Section 3.05, no
obligation,  right or liability shall arise hereunder, and each party shall bear
all of the expenses incurred by it in connection with the negotiation, drafting,
and  execution  of  this  Agreement  and  the  transactions herein contemplated.

               (b) This Agreement may be terminated by the board of directors of
          the  Company  at  any  time  prior  to  the  Closing  Date  if:

                    (i) the board of directors of the Company determines in good
               faith that one or more of the Company's conditions to Closing has
               not  occurred,  through  no  fault  of  the  Company.

                    (ii)  The  Company takes the termination action specified in
               Section  1.17 as a result of Hy-Tech Schedules or updates thereto
               which  the  Company  finds  unacceptable;  or

                    (iii)  Hy-Tech  shall fail to comply in any material respect
               with  any  of  its  covenants  or  agreements  contained  in this
               Agreement  or  if  any  of  the  representations or warranties of
               Hy-Tech  contained  herein  shall  be  inaccurate in any material
               respect,  where  such  noncompliance  or  inaccuracy has not been
               cured  within  ten  (10)  days  after  written  notice  thereof.

               latest  balance  sheet  of the Company in the assets, properties,
               business  or financial condition of the Company, which could have
               a  material  adverse  effect  on  the financial statements of the
               Company  listed  in  Section 2.04(b) taken as a whole, except any
               changes  disclosed  in  the  Company  Schedules;

                    (ii)  the  board  of directors of Hy-Tech determines in good
               faith that one or more of Hy-Tech's conditions to Closing has not
               occurred,  through  no  fault  of  Hy-Tech;

                    (iii)  Hy-Tech  takes  the  termination  action specified in

               thereto  which  Hy-Tech  finds  unacceptable;

                    (iv)  on  or  before  January 31, 2003, Hy-Tech notifies the
               Company  that  Hy-Tech's  investigation  pursuant to Section 4.01
               below  has  uncovered  information which it finds unacceptable by
               the  same  criteria  set  forth  in  Section  2.18;  or

                    (v) The Company shall fail to comply in any material respect
               with  any  of  its  covenants  or  agreements  contained  in this
               Agreement  or  if any of the representations or warranties of the
               Company  contained  herein  shall  be  inaccurate in any material
               respect,  where  such  noncompliance  or  inaccuracy has not been
               cured  within  ten  (10)  days  after  written  notice  thereof.

If  this Agreement is terminated pursuant to this paragraph (c) of Section 3.05,
this  Agreement shall be of no further force or effect, and no obligation, right
or liability shall arise hereunder, except that the Company shall bear the costs
as  well  as the reasonable costs of the Company incurred in connection with the
