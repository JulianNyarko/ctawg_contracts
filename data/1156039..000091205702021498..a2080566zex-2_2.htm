the Escrow Agent a certificate showing in reasonable detail the amount of out-of-pocket costs and expenses that are reasonably expected to be incurred in the future in
connection with the assessment or collection of the Indemnifiable Tax Costs and effecting the Net Insurance Recoveries, or which are described in the last sentence of Section&nbsp;2.07(c)(i). The
Policyholder Committee shall be entitled to dispute such amounts pursuant to the procedures set forth in Section&nbsp;2.07(i)&nbsp;(such amounts as finally resolved, and after giving credit for
any reasonably expected after-tax earnings thereon during the period for which such amounts will be retained in the Escrow Fund as determined by the Escrow Agent, being referred to as the
"</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Expected Costs and Expenses</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>"). When making any distribution from the Escrow Fund to the Eligible Policyholders, the Escrow Agent shall retain in the
Escrow Fund, and the amount of such distribution shall not include: (i)&nbsp;the amount, if any, attributable to all unresolved reimbursement disputes with respect to the Escrow Company Funds
Notices delivered by BCBSKS, (ii)&nbsp;the amount of any and all reserves which have been established with respect to Tax Escrow Disputes or pursuant to Section&nbsp;2.08(c)(iv)&nbsp;with
respect to Tax matters, for which, in either case, there has been no Final Determination, (iii)&nbsp;the Expected Costs and Expenses and (iv)&nbsp;any Taxes required to be withheld from
such distribution. Within ten (10)&nbsp;days after being notified in writing of the final resolution of any reimbursement dispute, or the Final Determination of any Tax Escrow Dispute or Tax matter
for which a reserve has been established pursuant to Section&nbsp;2.08(c)(iv), the Escrow Agent shall (i)&nbsp;distribute to BCBSKS all amounts resolved in favor of BCBSKS, together with interest
on such amounts (except for amounts attributable to a Tax Escrow Dispute or a Tax matter for which a reserve has been established pursuant to Section&nbsp;2.08(c)(iv)) at the rate of 7% per annum
calculated from the date of the applicable Escrow Company Funds Notice out of which the issue first arose, and (ii)&nbsp;the Escrow Agent shall distribute all amounts resolved in favor of the
Policyholder Committee to the Eligible Policyholders in accordance with the Plan of Conversion. Within ten (10)&nbsp;days after receipt of the final amounts that constitute the Net Insurance
Recoveries (the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Final Recoverable Amount</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>"), the Escrow Agent shall distribute the Final Recoverable Amount, plus the earnings in the Escrow Fund
thereon, and any amounts previously deposited in the Escrow Fund pursuant to Section&nbsp;2.07(c)(ii),to the Eligible Policyholders in accordance with the Plan of Conversion. The Policyholder
Committee may dispute the recovery and amount of any amounts that are reasonably recoverable in respect of the Contingent Litigation Matter in accordance with the provisions of Section&nbsp;2.07(i).
The Policyholder Committee may also direct the Escrow Agent to defer a distribution to the Eligible Policyholders and to accumulate the amount eligible for such distribution in the Escrow Fund for a
later aggregate distribution when the Policyholder Committee determines that it would be impractical to make current distributions, taking into account the costs of distribution in relation to the
amounts to be distributed. </FONT></P>

arithmetic errors in computation, (y)&nbsp;such amounts were not calculated in accordance with the definition of Closing Book Value in Section&nbsp;1.01, or (z)&nbsp;such amounts were not
arrived at using the same U.S. GAAP accounting principles and methods as those used in the preparation of, and as are reflected in, the Reference Balance Sheet, and Purchaser may not dispute any such
accounting principles and methods if such principles and methods were applied on a consistent basis; </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>provided, however</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> that Purchaser shall have
notified the Policyholder Committee and the PC's Accountants in writing of each disputed item, specifying the amount thereof in dispute and setting forth, in reasonable detail, the basis for such

shall attempt to reconcile their differences, and any resolution by them as to any disputed amounts shall be final, binding and conclusive on the parties hereto. If the PC's Accountants and the

that there is a reasonable basis for asserting that all or any part of any Tax deduction taken on any Return filed by BCBSKS on or before the Closing Date with respect to any Contingent Litigation
Matter Costs which were paid on or before the Closing Date may not be allowable under applicable law, Purchaser shall provide BCBSKS with a schedule, specifying in reasonable detail the amount of such
deduction and its calculation of the reserve that should be established to make BCBSKS whole for such disallowance. The Policyholder Committee may dispute the amount of such reserve but only on the
basis that (x)&nbsp;such amount was arrived at as a result of arithmetic errors in computation or (y)&nbsp;such reserve is not described in this Section&nbsp;2.08(c)(iv). Any such dispute shall
