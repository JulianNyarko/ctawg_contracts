                  accompanied by documentation satisfactory to OWNER as provided
                  in paragraph 13.02.A of the General Conditions).

                           e. When both additions and credits. ace involved in
                  any one change, the adjustment in DESIGN/BUILDER's fee shall

                  paragraphs 10.02.C.2.a through 10.02.C.2.d, inclusive.

         D. DOCUMENTATION: Whenever the cost of any Work is to be determined

to reflect actual amounts due DESIGN/BUILDER on account . of Work covered by
allowances, and the Contract Price shall be correspondingly adjusted.

10.04    UNIT PRICES

to be Unit Price Work, initially the Contract Price will be deemed to include
for all of Unit Price Work an amount equal to the sum of the established unit
prices for each separately identified item of Unit Price Work times the
estimated quantity of each item as indicated in the Agreement. The estimated
quantities of items of Unit Price Work are not guaranteed and are solely for the
purpose of comparison of Bids and determining an initial Contract Price.
Determinations of the actual quantities and classifications of Unit Price Work
performed by DESIGN/BUILDER will be made by OWNER.

                  2. there is no corresponding adjustment with respect to any
         other item of Work; and

                  3. DESIGN/BUILDER believes that DESIGN/BUILDER is entitled to
         an increase in Contract Price as a result of having incurred additional
         expense or OWNER believes the OWNER is entitled to a decrease in
         Contract Price and the parties are unable to agree as to the amount of
         any such increase or decrease.

pursuant to Article 10 to compensate for the direct costs incurred by
DESIGN/BUILDER due to delay, interference, or disruption directly attributable
to actions or inactions of OWNER or OWNER's Consultants. However, OWNER shall
not be liable to DESIGN/BUILDER for costs or damages arising out of or resulting
from (i) delays caused by or within the control of DESIGN/BUILDER, or (ii)
delays beyond the control of both parties including but not limited to fires,
floods, epidemics, abnormal weather conditions, acts of God or acts or neglect

         for Payment, either indicate in writing its acceptance of the
         Application and state that the Application is being processed for
         payment, or return the Application to DESIGN/BUILDER indicating in
         writing its seasons for refusing to accept the Application. Not more
         than ten days after accepting such Application the amount will become
         due and when due will be paid by OWNER to DESIGN/BUILDER.

                  2. If the OWNER should fail to pay the DESIGN/BUILDER at the
         time the payment of any amount becomes due, then DESIGN/BUILDER may, at
         any time thereafter, upon serving written notice that he will stop the
         Work within seven days after receipt of the notice by the OWNER, and
         after such seven day period, stop the Work until payment of the amount
         owing has been received. Written notice shall be deemed to have been
         duly served if sent by certified mail to the last known business
         address of the OWNER.

                  3. Payments due but unpaid shall bear interest at the rate
         specified in the Agreement.

                  4. No Progress Payment nor any partial or entire use or
         occupancy of the Project by the OWNER shall constitute an acceptance of
         any Work not in accordance with the Contract Documents.

         B. OWNER may refuse to make the whole or any part of any such
payment, or because of subsequently discovered evidence or the results of
subsequent inspections or tests, nullify any previous payment, to the extent
that is reasonably necessary to protect OWNER from loss because:

         requiring correction or replacement; or

                  2. The Contract Price has been reduced by Written Amendment or
         Change Order, or

                  3. OWNER has been required to correct defective Work or

         DESIGN/BUILDER's performance or furnishing of the Work; or

                  6. Liens have been filed in connection with the Work, except
         where DESIGN/BUILDER has delivered a specific Bond satisfactory to
         OWNER to secure the satisfaction and discharge of such Liens; or

                  7. There are other items entitling OWNER to a set off against
         the amount for which application is made.

13.05    SUBSTANTIAL COMPLETION

         A. When DESIGN/BUILDER considers the Construction ready for its
intended use DESIGN/BUILDER shall notify OWNER in writing that the Construction
is substantially complete (except for items specifically listed by
DESIGN/BUILDER as incomplete) and request that OWNER issue a certificate of
Substantial Completion. Within a reasonable time thereafter, OWNER and
DESIGN/BUILDER shall make an inspection of the Construction to determine the
status of completion. If OWNER does not consider the Construction substantially
complete, OWNER will notify DESIGN/BUILDER in writing giving the reasons
therefor. If OWNER considers the Construction substantially complete, OWNER will
prepare and deliver to DESIGN/BUILDER a certificate of Substantial Completion
which shall fix the date of Substantial Completion. There shall be attached to
the certificate a list of items to be completed or corrected before final
payment. At the time of delivery of the certificate of Substantial Completion
OWNER will deliver to DESIGN/BUILDER a written determination as to division of
responsibilities pending final, payment between OWNER and DESIGN/BUILDER, with
respect to security, operation, safety, maintenance, heat, utilities, insurance
and warranties and guarantees.

functioning and usable part of the Construction that can be used by OWNER for
its intended purpose without significant interference with DESIGN/BUILDER's
performance of the remainder of the Construction, may be accomplished prior to
Substantial Completion of all the Construction subject to the following:

                  1. OWNER ` at any time may request DESIGN/BUILDER in writing
         to permit OWNER to use any such part of the Construction which OWNER
         believes to be ready for, its intended use and substantially complete.
         If DESIGN/BUILDER agrees that such part of

         and request OWNER to issue a certificate of Substantial Completion for
         that part of the Construction DESIGN/BUILDER at any time may notify
         OWNER in writing that DESIGN/BUILDER considers any such part of the
         Construction ready for its intended use and substantially complete and
         request OWNER to issue a certificate of Substantial Completion for that
         part of the Construction. Within a reasonable time after either such
         request, OWNER and DESIGN/BUILDER shall make an inspection of that part
         of the Construction to determine its status of completion. If OWNER
         does not consider that part of the Construction to be substantially
         complete, OWNER will notify DESIGN/BUILDER. in writing giving the
         masons therefor. If OWNER considers that part of the Construction to be
         substantially complete, the provisions of paragraph 13.05 will apply
         with respect to certification of Substantial Completion of that part of
         the Construction and the division of responsibility in respect thereof
         and access thereto.

                  2. No occupancy or separate operation of part of the
         Construction will be accomplished prior to compliance with the
         requirements of paragraph 5.08 in respect of property insurance.

13.07    FINAL INSPECTION

         A. Upon written notice from DESIGN/BUILDER that the entire Construction
or an agreed portion thereof is complete, OWNER will make a final inspection
with DESIGN/BUILDER and will notify DESIGN/BUILDER in writing of all particulars
in which this inspection reveals that the Construction is incomplete or
defective. DESIGN/BUILDER shall immediately take such measures as are necessary
to complete such Construction or remedy such deficiencies.

DESIGN/BUILDER's other obligations under the Contract Documents have been
fulfilled, OWNER will, within ten days after receipt of the final Application
for Payment, give written notice to DESIGN/BUILDER that the Work is acceptable.
Otherwise, OWNER will return the Application to DESIGN/BUILDER, indicating in

surety to the payment of the balance due for that portion of the Work fully
completed and accepted shall be submitted by DESIGN/BUILDER to OWNER with the

conditions governing final payment, except that it shall not constitute a waiver
of claims.

13.10    WAIVER OF CLAIMS

                  1. A waiver of all claims by OWNER against DESIGN/BUILDER,
         except claims arising from unsettled Liens, from defective Construction
         appearing after final inspection pursuant to paragraph 13.07, from
         failure to comply with the Contract Documents or the terms of any
         special guarantees specified therein, or from DESIGN/BUILDER's
         continuing obligations under the Contract Documents; and

         accordance with the Contract Documents (including, but not limited to,
         failure to supply sufficient skilled workers or suitable materials or
         equipment or failure to adhere to the progress schedule established
         under paragraph 2.06.A as revised from time to time.

                  2. DESIGN/BUILDER disregards Laws or Regulations of any public

for trespass or conversion), incorporate in the Work all materials and equipment
stored at the Site or for which OWNER has paid DESIGN/BUILDER but which are
stored elsewhere, and finish the Work as OWNER may deem expedient. In such case

losses and damages sustained by OWNER arising out of or resulting from
completing the Work (including but not limited to all fees and charges of
engineers, architects, attorneys and other professionals and all court or
arbitration or other dispute resolution costs) such excess will be paid to
DESIGN/BUILDER. If such costs, losses and damages exceed such unpaid balance,

incurred by OWNER will be incorporated in a Change Order, provided that when
exercising any rights or remedies under this paragraph OWNER shall not be
required. to, obtain the lowest price for the Work performed.' .

         C. Where DESIGN/BUILDERs services have been so terminated by OWNER, the
termination will not affect any rights or remedies of OWNER against
DESIGN/BUILDER then existing or which may thereafter accrue. Any retention or
payment of moneys due DESIGN/BUILDER by OWNER will not release DESIGN/BUILDER
from liability.

upon seven days' written notice to OWNER, and provided OWNER does not remedy
such suspension or failure within that time, terminate the Agreement and recover
from OWNER payment on the same terms as provided in paragraph 14.03A. In lieu of
terminating the Agreement and without prejudice to any other right or remedy, or
OWNER has failed for thirty days to pay DESIGN/BUILDER any sum finally
determined to be due, DESIGN/BUILDER may upon seven day's written notice to
OWNER stop the Work until payment is made of all such amounts due
DESIGN/BUILDER, including interest thereon. The provisions of this paragraph
14.04.A are not intended to preclude DESIGN/BUILDER from making claim under
