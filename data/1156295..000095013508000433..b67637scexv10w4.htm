<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><U>Section&nbsp;3. Eligibility; Participants</U>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Administrator shall determine which management employees of the Employer are eligible to
participate in the Plan for any Plan Year or portion thereof. Except as the Administrator
otherwise determines, however, all employees of the Employer with a management title of &#147;Director&#148;
or higher, and only such employees, shall be eligible to participate. Participation in the Plan
for any Plan Year shall not, in and of itself, entitle an individual to continued participation in
the Plan for future Plan Years.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><U>Section&nbsp;4. Awards</U>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.1. <U>Grant of Award Opportunities</U>. For each Plan Year, the Administrator shall grant
an Award Opportunity to each Participant for such Plan Year. Each Award Opportunity shall be
communicated to the Participant in writing, in such form as the Administrator may determine, and
shall give the Participant a conditional right to earn an Award Payment if (i)&nbsp;the Performance
Goals specified by the Administrator are determined by the Administrator to have been achieved at
levels sufficient to justify a payment (as determined by the Administrator), and (ii)&nbsp;the
Participant remains employed by the Employer until the date on which the Award Payment, if any, is
made.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.2. <U>Establishment of Performance Goals</U>. The Performance Goals with respect to any
Award Opportunity for any Plan Year shall be determined by the Administrator, may vary among
Participants, may include a range of performance objectives, may specify minimum levels of
performance below which no Award Payments will be made, and may contain such other terms and
conditions as the Administrator may specify. Except as the Administrator otherwise determines in
any case, each Award Opportunity shall include a measure based on Company performance and a measure
based on individual performance, which shall be given such weights as the Administrator determines.
In determining any Performance Goals, the Administrator shall take into account but shall not be
bound by management recommendations.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.3. <U>Adjustments</U>. The Administrator may, without regard to the limitations of
Section7.2, adjust Performance Goals or the weighting of such Goals to reflect acquisitions,
dispositions, stock dividends or combinations or other events affecting the Company&#146;s capital
stock, changes in accounting principles or practices, or any other factor or factors which in the
Administrator&#146;s determination require an adjustment to avoid distortion in the operation of, or to
carry out the intent of, the Plan.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.4. <U>Determination of Award Payment Amounts</U>. As soon as practical after the close of
the relevant Plan Year, the Administrator shall determine the extent, if any, to which the
Performance Goals applicable to each Award Opportunity have been achieved and the resulting Award
Amounts, if any, to be paid. The Administrator may provide for prorated Award Payments to reflect
participation for less than a full Plan Year or for such other reasons as the Administrator may
specify. Except as the Board otherwise provides, the determination of the Administrator shall be
final and binding on all parties.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.6. <U>Board Authority</U>. The Board may, with or without prior notice override or modify
any determination of the Administrator, including, without limitation, with respect to the
achievement of Performance Goals or the amount of any Award Payment, but except as so overridden or
modified the determinations of the Administrator shall be binding on all parties.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.1. <U>Requirement of Continued Employment</U>. Except as otherwise provided under a
separate employment agreement, a Participant shall be entitled to receive an Award Payment, if any,
with respect to an Award Opportunity only if the Participant remains continuously employed by the
Employer until the date payment is made.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.2. <U>Time of Payment</U>. Each Award Payment shall be made as soon as practicable after

the close of the Plan Year.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subject to the Board&#146;s authority under Section&nbsp;4.6, the Administrator shall have complete
discretion and authority to interpret the Plan and any Award Opportunity established under the
Plan, to determine eligibility for participation, to determine Performance Goals and the extent, if
any, to which any Performance Goal has been achieved, to establish forms and procedures for use
under the Plan, and generally to all things necessary or appropriate to administer the Plan.

Payments such taxes and other required withholdings as it determines to be appropriate.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7.2. <U>Amendment or Termination</U>. The Board or, to the extent it so determines, the
Committee may, with prospective or retroactive effect, amend, suspend, or terminate the Plan or
portion thereof, or amend any Award Opportunity, at any time; provided, that no amendment,
suspension, or termination of the Plan and no amendment of any Award Opportunity shall materially
and adversely affect the rights of any Participant under any Award Opportunity that has already
been granted without the consent of the affected Participant.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7.3. <U>Other Payments or Awards</U>. Nothing contained in the Plan will be deemed in any
way to limit, restrict or require the Employer from making any award or payment to any person under
any other plan, arrangement or understanding, whether now existing or hereafter in effect.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7.4. <U>Unfunded Plan</U>. Nothing in this Plan shall be construed to require the Company,
the Administrator or any other person to establish a trust or otherwise to set aside assets to meet
the Employer&#146;s obligations hereunder. The rights, if any, of a Participant hereunder shall be no
greater than those of an unsecured general creditors of the Employer.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7.6. <U>No liability</U>. No member of the Board, the Committee, or any director, officer or
employee of the Employer will be liable, responsible or accountable in damages or otherwise for any
determination made or other action taken or any failure to act by such person in connection with
the administration of the Plan, so long as such person is not determined by a final adjudication to
be guilty of willful misconduct with respect to such determination, action or failure to act.

under the Plan shall be construed as creating any contract of employment or conferring upon any
employee or Participant any right to continue in the employ or other service of the Employer, or as
limiting in any way the right of the Employer to change such person&#146;s compensation or other
benefits or to terminate the employment or other service of such person with or without cause.
