(B)&nbsp;Executive shall be given an opportunity to make a presentation to the Board (accompanied by counsel or other representative, if Executive so desires) at a meeting of the Board held promptly following such 45-day cure period if the Board
intends to determine that no cure has occurred. At or following such meeting, the Board shall determine whether or not to terminate Executive with Cause and shall notify Executive of its determination and the effective date of such termination
(which date may be no earlier than the date of the aforementioned Board meeting). For purposes hereof, no act or omission shall be deemed &#147;willful&#148; if it was done with a good faith belief that it was in the best interests of the Company.

the last day of the then-current Term. </FONT></P>
