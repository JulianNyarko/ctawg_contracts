name (the &#147;Licensed Name&#148;), and the right to use the Licensed Marks, in the sale, marketing and administration of health care plans and related services in the Service Area set forth and defined in paragraph 5 below. As used herein, health
care plans and related services shall include acting as a nonprofit health care plan, a for-profit health care plan, or mutual health insurer operating on a not-for-profit or for-profit basis, under state law; financing access to health care
services; the offering of debit cards used solely to support access to tax-favored savings accounts for medical expenses, subject to a license from BCBSA to the card issuer; providing health care management and administration; administering, but not

in the Agreement attached as Exhibit 1 hereto (the &#147;Controlled Affiliate License Agreement&#148;); and: b) insurance coverages offered by life insurers under the applicable law in the Service Area, other than those which the Plan may offer in
its own name, provided through Controlled Affiliates, provided that each such Controlled Affiliate is separately licensed to use the Licensed Marks and Name under the terms and conditions contained in the Agreement attached as Exhibit 1A hereto (the
&#147;Controlled Affiliate License Agreement Applicable to Life Insurance Companies&#148;) and further provided that the offering of such services does not and will not dilute or tarnish the unique value of the Licensed Marks and Name; and c)
administration and underwriting of Workers&#146; Compensation Insurance Controlled Affiliates, provided that each such Controlled Affiliate is separately licensed to use the Licensed Marks and Name under the terms and conditions contained in the
Agreement attached as Exhibit 1 hereto (the &#147;Controlled Affiliate License.&#148;); and d) regional Medicare Advantage PPO Products in cooperation with one or more other Plans through jointly-held Controlled Affiliates, provided that each such
Controlled Affiliate is separately licensed to use the Licensed Marks and Name under the terms and conditions contained in the Agreement attached as Exhibit 1B hereto (the &#147;Controlled Affiliate License Agreement Applicable to Regional Medicare

subparagraph A of this paragraph, the entity, its owners, and persons with authority to select or appoint members or board members, other than a Plan or Plans, have received written approval of BCBSA. Absent written approval by BCBSA of an
alternative method of control, bona fide control with respect to the Controlled Affiliate Licenses authorized in clauses a) through c) of this Paragraph 2 shall mean that a Plan or Plans authorized to use the Licensed Marks in the Service Area of
the Controlled Affiliate pursuant to this License Agreement(s) with BCBSA, other than such Controlled Affiliate&#146;s License Agreement(s), (for purposes of subparagraphs 2.A. and 2.B., the &#147;Controlling Plan(s)&#148;), must have: </FONT></P>

National Accounts, Government Programs and certain other necessary and collateral uses, the current rules and regulations governing which are attached as Exhibit 3 and Exhibit 4 hereto, and are contained in other documents referenced herein, or as
expressly provided herein, the Plan may not use the Licensed Marks and Name outside the Service Area or in connection with other goods and services, nor may the Plan use the Licensed Marks or Name in a manner which is intended to transfer in the

Plan&#146;s use of the Licensed Marks and Names outside the Service Area provided that the procedure used in imposing a fine is consistent with procedures specifically prescribed by BCBSA from time to time in regulations of general application. In
the case of regional Medicare Advantage PPO and regional Medicare Part D Prescription Drug Plan products offered by consenting and participating Plans in a region that includes the Service Areas, or portions thereof, of more than one Plan, such fine
may be imposed jointly on the consenting and participating Plans for use of the Licensed Marks and Name in any geographic area of the region in which a Plan having exclusive rights to the Licensed Marks and Name does not consent to and participate

administrative expense per Licensed Enrollee was $278.60, $285.00 and $290.00 for calendar year end 2004, 2005 and 2006, respectively, the January&nbsp;1, 2007 Re-Establishment Fee would be $83.27 (100% of the base fee plus $1.84 for calendar year
2005 and $1.43 for calendar year 2006). Licensed Enrollee means each and every person and covered dependent who is enrolled as an individual or member of a group receiving products or services sold, marketed or administered under marks or names
licensed by BCBSA as determined at the earlier of (a)&nbsp;the end of the last fiscal year of the terminated entity which ended prior to termination or (b)&nbsp;the fiscal year which ended before any transactions causing the termination began.

through December&nbsp;31, 2005 shall be $80. The Re-Establishment Fee for calendar years after December&nbsp;31, 2005 shall be adjusted on January&nbsp;1 of each calendar year up to and including January&nbsp;1, 2010 and shall be the base fee

at which time the Re-Establishment Fee shall be fixed at the then-current amount and no longer automatically adjusted. For example, if the Plans&#146; gross administrative expense per Licensed Enrollee was $278.60, $285.00 and $290.00 for calendar
year end 2004, 2005 and 2006, respectively, the January&nbsp;1, 2007 Re-Establishment Fee would be $83.27 (100% of base fee plus $1.84 for calendar year 2005 and $1.43 for calendar year 2006. Licensed Enrollee means each and every person and covered
dependent who is enrolled as an individual or member of a group receiving products or services sold, marketed or administered under marks or names licensed by BCBSA as determined at the earlier of (i)&nbsp;the end of the last fiscal year of the
terminated entity which ended prior to termination or (ii)&nbsp;the fiscal year which ended before any transactions causing the termination began. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the amount payable pursuant to this subparagraph H. (3)&nbsp;shall be
due only to the extent that, in BCBSA&#146;s opinion, it does not cause the net worth of the Controlled Affiliate, the Plan or any other Licensed Controlled Affiliates of the Plan to fall below 100% of the Health Risk-Based Capital formula, or its
equivalent under any successor formula, as set forth in the applicable financial responsibility standards established by BCBSA (provided such equivalent is approved for purposes of this sub paragraph by the affirmative vote of three-fourths of the
Plans and three-fourths of the total then current weighted vote of all the Plans); measured as of the date of termination, and adjusted for the value of any transactions not made in the ordinary course of business. This payment shall not be due in
connection with transactions exclusively by or among Plans or their affiliates, including reorganizations, combinations or mergers, where the BCBSA Board of Directors determines that the license termination does not result in a material diminution
in the number of Licensed Enrollees or the extent of their coverage. At least 50% of the Re-Establishment Fee shall be awarded to the Plan (or Plans) that receive the new license(s) for the service area(s) at issue; provided, however, that such
award shall not become due or payable until all disputes, if any, regarding the amount of and BCBSA&#146;s right to such Re-Establishment Fee have been finally resolved; and provided further that the award shall be based on the final amount actually
received by BCBSA. The Board of Directors shall adopt a resolution which it may amend from time to time that shall govern BCBSA&#146;s use of its portion of the award. In the event that the Controlled Affiliate&#146;s license is reinstated by BCBSA
or is deemed to have remained in effect without interruption by a court of competent jurisdiction, BCBSA shall reimburse the Controlled Affiliate (and/or the Plan or its other Licensed Controlled Affiliates, as the case may be) for payments made
under this subparagraph 7.H.(3) only to the extent that such payments exceed the amounts due to BCBSA pursuant to paragraph 7.M. and any cost associated with reestablishing the Service Area, including any payments made by BCBSA to a Plan or Plans
