President, upon the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth and Executive wishes to continue
such employment; and

the Transition Date, as Chief Executive Officer and Executive hereby accepts such employment.
Executive shall continue to perform his current duties and shall report to Employer&#146;s Chief
Executive Officer until the Transition Date. From and after the Transition Date, Executive&#146;s
duties shall include, but not be limited to, the performance of all duties associated with
managing and/or overseeing the day to day functions of CME-wide operations (but not including
Government Relations, Corporate Marketing and Communications, which shall be the direct
responsibility of Employer&#146;s Executive Chairman and President) and such other duties as are
the responsibility of Employer&#146;s chief executive officer pursuant to applicable law or
regulation. From and after the Transition Date, through the remainder of the Agreement Term,
Executive shall report to Employer&#146;s Executive Chairman and President, with approval of
Executive&#146;s annual goals, performance review and retention or termination by Employer&#146;s Board
of Directors (the &#147;Board&#148;). Executive will provide such business and professional services in
the performance of his duties that are consistent with Executive&#146;s position, and as shall
reasonably be assigned to him by the Executive Chairman and President or the Board. Executive
shall devote his full time, ability and attention to the business of Employer during the
Agreement Term. During the Agreement Term, Executive shall comply with the Company&#146;s share
ownership guidelines as in effect from time to time. To the extent provided in Employer&#146;s
by-laws, Executive will be nominated as a member of the Board during the Agreement Term.</TD>

governmental, educational or other charitable institution and serving as a member of the
board of directors of a corporation, except for a competitor of Employer, provided Executive
notifies the Governance Committee of the Board prior to his participating in any such
activities and as long as the Governance Committee does not determine that any such
activities interfere with or diminish Executive&#146;s obligations under the Agreement.
Executive shall be entitled to retain all fees and other compensation derived from such
activities, in addition to the compensation and other benefits payable to him under the
Agreement, but shall disclose such fees to Employer.

this Section 7(f) for such 12&nbsp;month period. In the event that Executive elects to
continue such coverage, Employer shall pay to Executive an amount, in a lump sum within
30&nbsp;days following the commencement of such 12&nbsp;month period, equal to 150% of
Executive&#146;s total potential monthly cost for such coverage for such 12&nbsp;month period
(based upon the rates in effect at the time of such election). No payment will be made
if (and to the extent) Executive does not elect to continue coverage. Notwithstanding
the foregoing timing requirements, with respect to the initial 12&nbsp;month period, payment
of the lump sum amounts payable under this Section 7(f) up to the maximum amount
allowed for de minimis payments under IRS Code Section&nbsp;409A (&#147;Section&nbsp;409A&#148;) shall be
paid within fourteen (14)&nbsp;days of termination of Executive&#146;s employment. The remainder
of the lump sum amounts with respect to the first 12&nbsp;month period, if any, shall be
paid six (6)&nbsp;months after the date Executive terminates employment. Notwithstanding
anything in this Section 7(f) to the contrary, Executive&#146;s continued coverage under
such plans shall end upon the date, if any, when Executive obtains comparable coverage
(as compared to the coverage provided under the applicable plans of Employer) from a
subsequent employer of Executive or Executive&#146;s spouse.</TD>
