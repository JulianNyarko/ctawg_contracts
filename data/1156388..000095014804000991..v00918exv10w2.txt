         THIS LEASE ("LEASE") is made and entered into as of the 14th day of
April, 2004, by and between PANATTONI DEVELOPMENT COMPANY, LLC, a California
limited liability company ("LANDLORD"), owner of the Premises (defined in the
following paragraph below), and BIG 5 CORP., a Delaware corporation ("TENANT").

                                    RECITALS

         A.       Land, Building and Premises. That for and in consideration of
the rental hereinafter reserved, and of the mutual covenants, agreements, and
conditions hereinafter contained, and upon all of the terms and provisions of
this Lease, Landlord does hereby lease to Tenant, and Tenant does hereby rent
from Landlord, for the Term as set forth in Article 1 below, the following
(collectively, the "PREMISES"): (i) that certain parcel of real property (the
"LAND") containing approximately 46.64 gross acres (approximately 44.81 net
acres after dedication of Crest Ridge Drive and the expansion parcel for
Sycamore Canyon Boulevard to the City of Riverside, as contemplated by the
Proposed Final Map, as defined below), situated on Sycamore Canyon Boulevard, in
the City of Riverside, County of Riverside, State of California, as more
particularly described in Exhibit A attached hereto and made a part hereof and
more particularly shown on the site plan attached hereto as Exhibit B-1 and made
a part hereof (the "SITE PLAN"); (ii) the warehouse/distribution building (the
"BUILDING") having dimensions of approximately 1,560 feet by 600 feet and
containing a total of approximately 953,132 square feet of Rentable Area (as
defined in Paragraph 1.6 below) to be constructed by Landlord on the Land
pursuant to the terms and provisions of this Lease, which Rentable Area shall be
subject to adjustment in accordance with Paragraph 1.6 below; (iii) the
"IMPROVEMENTS", which means, collectively, the Building and all other
structures, driveways, entrances and exits, parking areas, landscaping,
utilities, drainage facilities, lighting and curb cuts, and all other
improvements and fixtures (excluding Tenant's trade fixtures and personal
property) now or hereafter located on the Land; and (iv) all easements, rights
and appurtenances now or hereafter appurtenant thereto.

         B.       Acquisition and Subdivision of Land. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained in this Lease, the parties acknowledge and agree that
Landlord does not currently own the Land, and the Land is part of a larger
approximately 96 acre parcel (the "LARGER PARCEL") as depicted on the Proposed
Final Map which is in the process of being purchased and subdivided by Landlord.
It is anticipated by the parties that on or before June 1, 2004 (the
"ACQUISITION OUTSIDE DATE"), Landlord will cause all of the following events
(herein referred to collectively as the "LAND ACQUISITION") to occur: (i)
acquisition by Landlord of fee simple title to the Larger Parcel (including the
Land) from the current owner thereof, as evidenced by the recordation of a grant
deed in favor of Landlord for the Larger Parcel (including the Land) in the
official records of the county in which the Premises are located (the "OFFICIAL
RECORDS"); and (ii) recordation of the Memorandum of Lease (as defined in
Paragraph 20.2 below) in the Official Records immediately following the
recordation of such grant deed. It is also anticipated by the parties that on or
before October 1, 2004 (the "SUBDIVISION OUTSIDE DATE"), Landlord will cause all
of the following events (hereinafter referred to collectively as the
"SUBDIVISION") to occur: (A) the subdivision of the Land from the Larger Parcel
into a legally subdivided parcel pursuant to a final parcel map recorded in the
Official Records, which final parcel map shall be based upon and substantially
in accordance with that certain proposed final parcel map no. 31139-1 (the
"PROPOSED FINAL MAP") on which the Land is depicted as Parcel 1 thereof (a copy
of which

                                      -1-
<PAGE>

BIG 5 WAREHOUSE
RIVERSIDE, CALIFORNIA

Proposed Final Map is attached hereto as Exhibit B-2), and subject only to the
conditions for such subdivision as set forth on the Proposed Final Map (which
conditions Landlord shall satisfy and cause to be deleted, at its expense, prior
to recordation of such final parcel map); (B) subject to the following
provisions of this Recital B, recordation in the Official Records of a
memorandum of lease amendment (the "MEMORANDUM OF LEASE AMENDMENT") to be
executed by the parties as provided in Paragraph 20.2 below, which modifies the
Memorandum of Lease to (1) reflect that the subdivision of the Land from the
Larger Parcel has occurred, and (2) attach thereto the legal description of the
Land, as so subdivided, as the land component of the Premises; and (C) receipt
by Tenant of the Leasehold Title Policy or Leasehold Title Commitment for the
Premises, as the case may be, as defined in and pursuant to the provisions of
Paragraph 3.3 below. It is currently contemplated by the parties that the Land
Acquisition will occur prior to the Subdivision, but in the event Landlord
causes the Land Acquisition and Subdivision to occur concurrently, then
notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of Recital B to the contrary, (1) the
parties shall not record the Memorandum of Lease Amendment, and (2) prior to
recordation of the Memorandum of Lease, a modified version of the Memorandum of
Lease shall be executed by the parties and delivered to the escrow holder
described in Paragraph 20.2 below in substitution for the originally executed
Memorandum of Lease in order to eliminate references to the Larger Parcel and
such Subdivision and to reference and attach thereto as an exhibit the legal
description of the Land, as so subdivided, as the land component of the
Premises. If Landlord fails to either (x) effect the Land Acquisition by the
Acquisition Outside Date, as evidenced by written notice thereof (together with
conformed copies of the recorded grant deed of the Larger Parcel, including the
Land, in favor of Landlord and the recorded Memorandum of Lease) delivered by
Landlord to Tenant on or before such Acquisition Outside Date, or (y) effect the
Subdivision by the Subdivision Outside Date, as evidenced by written notice
thereof together with conformed copies of the recorded final parcel map
subdividing the Land from the Larger Parcel, and the recorded Memorandum of
Lease Amendment (if applicable), then, in either such case, and in addition to
Tenant's other rights and remedies set forth in this Lease, Tenant shall have
the rights set forth in Paragraph 1.5 below.

ARTICLE 1: TERM.

         1.1      Commencement Date. The term of this Lease (the "TERM") shall
be for a period of approximately ten (10) years commencing upon the Commencement
Date (as defined hereinbelow), and expiring upon the date (the "EXPIRATION
DATE") that is the last day of the calendar month which is ten (10) years after
the Commencement Date, unless extended or sooner terminated as provided in this
Lease. The "COMMENCEMENT DATE" shall be the date that is the earlier of: (i) the
later of (A) January 1, 2005, and (B) that date which is ninety (90) days after
the date (the "DELIVERY DATE") Landlord delivers to Tenant possession of the
Premises in the Delivery Condition (as defined in Paragraph 1.4.1 below),
subject, however to acceleration (but not before January 1, 2005) due to Tenant
Delays (as defined and provided in Paragraph 6 of Exhibit C) and/or extension
and postponement as provided in Paragraph 1.2 below; or (ii) the date Tenant
actually commences its ordinary business operations in the Building (which shall
be subject to Tenant obtaining all applicable licenses therefor required by
Applicable Laws, as defined in Paragraph 1.2 below). For purposes of this
Paragraph 1.1, Tenant shall be considered to have commenced its ordinary
business operations in the Building when it has personnel and inventory on-site
within the Building and is able to commence distribution of that inventory from
the Building. Accordingly, the mere fact that Tenant has commenced the storage
of inventory at

                                      -2-
<PAGE>

BIG 5 WAREHOUSE
RIVERSIDE, CALIFORNIA

the Premises shall not be considered the commencement of its ordinary business
operations in the Building. Landlord shall give Tenant thirty (30) days' advance
notice of the date possession of the Premises shall be delivered to Tenant in
the Delivery Condition. Said delivery of possession of the Premises to Tenant in
the Delivery Condition shall be made in full compliance with the terms and
conditions of Article 3 of this Lease and Exhibit C attached hereto.

         1.2      Fixturization Period. During such ninety (90) day period set
forth in Paragraph 1.1 above (the "FIXTURIZATION PERIOD"), Tenant intends to
install certain "Fixturization Work" within the Building, as defined and
described in Exhibit C attached hereto, and in connection with the installation
of the Fixturization Work: (i) Tenant shall have uninterrupted access to the
Building and Premises to install the Fixturization Work during the Fixturization
Period, subject, however, to Landlord's rights of access as are reasonably
necessary for Landlord to complete Landlord's Work and make the Premises Ready
for Occupancy (as defined in Paragraph 1.4.2 below) during the ninety (90) day
period immediately following the Delivery Date; and (ii) Landlord shall use
commercially reasonable efforts, at no cost to Landlord, to assist Tenant in
obtaining (at Tenant's expense) all governmental permits and approvals for such
Fixturization Work (including, without limitation, racking permits, applicable
fire department approvals and permits for Tenant's proposed guns and ammunition
areas in the Building). If Tenant's installation of the Fixturization Work
and/or commencement of Tenant's ordinary business operations in the Building
following delivery of possession thereof to Tenant in the Delivery Condition
shall be delayed by reason of any Landlord Delays (as defined in Paragraph 1.3
below), then the Fixturization Period shall be extended and accordingly the
Commencement Date of the Term of this Lease shall be postponed for a period
equal to the duration of such Landlord Delays. In the event any of such Landlord
Delays delay Tenant's commencement of business operations in the Building for a
period beyond the date which is eighteen (18) months after the date of execution
of this Lease (the "OUTSIDE OPERATIONS DATE"), Tenant may elect to terminate
this Lease by written notice delivered to Landlord within sixty (60) days after
the Outside Operations Date, and Tenant shall be entitled to receive from
Landlord the Tenant Termination Payment as defined in and pursuant to Paragraph
1.5.5 below.

         1.3      Landlord Delays. As used herein, "LANDLORD DELAYS" shall mean
any delays in the installation of the Fixturization Work, and/or the
commencement of Tenant's ordinary business operations in the Building following
delivery of possession of the Premises to Tenant in the Delivery Condition,
actually caused by any of the following (but only to the extent such delays are
not caused by Tenant Delays or Force Majeure Delays, as defined in Paragraph
1.5.4 below):

                  (i)      Landlord's failure or refusal to (A) give
authorizations, approvals or disapprovals within the time periods required under
this Lease or Exhibit C, (B) disburse and/or pay when due the cost of Landlord's
Work required to be paid for by Landlord (including disbursement of the Tenant
Improvement Allowance) in accordance with Exhibit C, or (C) otherwise comply
with the time deadlines and/or schedules set forth in this Lease and/or Exhibit
C;

                  (ii)     Landlord's breach of any provisions of this Lease or
Exhibit C;

                                      -3-
<PAGE>

BIG 5 WAREHOUSE
RIVERSIDE, CALIFORNIA

                  (iii)    any unreasonable interference with Tenant's
installation of the Fixturization Work caused by Landlord's Work, including,
without limitation, any failure by Landlord to provide Tenant with uninterrupted
access to the Building and Premises to install the Fixturization Work after the
Delivery Date as required in Paragraph 1.2 above and thereafter commence its
ordinary business operations in the Building;

                  (iv)     (A) any defects in the design and/or construction of
Landlord's Work or failure of Landlord to comply with all Applicable Laws and/or
the requirements of Exhibit C in connection with the design and construction of
Landlord's Work, including, without limitation, any failure of Landlord's Work
to meet the Delivery Condition requirements as of the date the Premises are
delivered to Tenant, and/or (B) incorrect or incomplete Final Plans (as defined
in Exhibit C) for Landlord's Work and/or the failure of the Final Plans to
comply with Applicable Laws or otherwise meet the requirements set forth in
Exhibit C;

                  (v)      revisions made to the Final Plans after approval
thereof by Landlord and Tenant unless required by Tenant Change Orders (as
defined in Exhibit C) requested by Tenant pursuant to Exhibit C;

                  (vi)     Landlord's failure to complete Landlord's Work and
make the Premises Ready for Occupancy within the ninety (90) day period
following the Delivery Date; and/or

                  (vii)    any other acts, negligence or omissions of or by
Landlord or Landlord's employees, agents, contractors, licensees or invitees.

         1.4      Delivery Condition; Ready for Occupancy.

                  1.4.1    Delivery Condition. For purposes hereof, the Premises
shall be deemed to be in the "DELIVERY CONDITION" after Landlord has caused both
the Land Acquisition and the Subdivision to occur, and when all of Landlord's
Work for the Premises to be constructed by Landlord pursuant to Exhibit C has
been completed to the extent set forth on Exhibit I attached hereto, and
otherwise to such extent so as to not unreasonably delay or interfere with
Tenant's installation of the Fixturization Work described in Paragraph 1.2
above. Immediately prior to Landlord's delivery of possession of the Premises to
Tenant in the Delivery Condition, Landlord and Tenant shall conduct a joint
walk-through of the Premises to confirm whether or not the Premises are in fact
in the Delivery Condition as described in and required by Exhibit I and this
Paragraph 1.4.1. The parties acknowledge and agree that the Delivery Date will
occur prior to completion of all of Landlord's Work, and that Landlord will be
completing the remainder of Landlord's Work and causing the Premises to be Ready
for Occupancy during Tenant's Fixturization Period while Tenant is installing
the Fixturization Work.

                  1.4.2    Ready for Occupancy. Landlord covenants to complete
Landlord's Work (subject to the Punchlist Items, as defined below in this
Paragraph 1.4.2) and cause the Premises to be Ready for Occupancy within ninety
(90) days after the Delivery Date. For purposes hereof, the Premises shall be
deemed "READY FOR OCCUPANCY" when:

                           (i)      Landlord has caused both the Land
Acquisition and the Subdivision to occur;

                           (ii)     all of Landlord's Work has been completed in
accordance with the Final Plans, all Applicable Laws, and the provisions of
Exhibit C, excepting only those incomplete items of finishing and/or correction
work (collectively, the "PUNCHLIST ITEMS") which (A) are of such a nature that
they will not and do not unreasonably delay or interfere with Tenant's
completion of the Fixturization Work or Tenant's commencement of its ordinary
business operations from the Premises following Tenant's completion of the
Fixturization Work, and (B) are identified on a list to be jointly prepared and
mutually agreed upon by Landlord and Tenant as provided hereinbelow (provided,
however, that such Punchlist Items shall be completed by Landlord within thirty
(30) days after such substantial completion);

                           (iii)    a certificate of occupancy (or a temporary
certificate of occupancy or its equivalent, subject to conditions reasonably
acceptable to Tenant) with respect to Landlord's Work has been issued by the
City of Riverside, and a copy of the same has been delivered to Tenant;

                           (iv)     all Premises systems and utilities
(including, without limitation, water, electricity, and HVAC) are in good
working order and operation;

                           (v)      Landlord's Contractor (as defined in Exhibit
C) has executed a Certificate in the form attached as Schedule 2 to Exhibit C,
and a copy of same has been delivered to Tenant; and

                           (vi)     Landlord's Architect has executed a
Certificate in the form of the AIA Certificate of Substantial Completion
(G704-1978), and a copy of same has been delivered to Tenant.

Within ten (10) days after Landlord has made the Premises Ready for Occupancy
and delivered to Tenant the certificates described in clauses (iii), (v) and
(vi) hereinabove, Landlord and Tenant will jointly conduct a walk-through
inspection of the Premises and will jointly prepare an agreed upon list of
Punchlist Items to be performed by Landlord pursuant to Exhibit C.

         1.5      Failure to Effect Land Acquisition or Subdivision, Commence
Grading, Obtain Permits, Achieve Delivery Condition or Complete Landlord's Work.

                  1.5.1    If Landlord fails to (i) effect the Land Acquisition
by the Acquisition Outside Date, or (ii) effect the Subdivision by the
Subdivision Outside Date, or (iii) commence grading of the Land ("GRADING
COMMENCEMENT") by August 15, 2004 (the "GRADING COMMENCEMENT OUTSIDE DATE"), as
such date in this clause (iii) may be extended as provided in Paragraph 1.5.4
below, or (iv) obtain from the appropriate governmental authorities all
necessary building permits and approvals to construct Landlord's Work (the
"PERMIT ISSUANCE") by August 15, 2004 (the "PERMIT ISSUANCE OUTSIDE DATE"), as
such date in this clause (iv) may be extended as provided in Paragraph 1.5.4
below, then in addition to Tenant's other rights and remedies set forth in this
Lease, Tenant may, at any time thereafter but prior to the date the Land
Acquisition, Subdivision, Grading Commencement or Permit Issuance (as the case
may be) has occurred, either (A) terminate this Lease upon ten (10) days' prior

(as the case may be) to a later date as designated by Tenant in its sole and
absolute discretion in a written notice delivered by Tenant to Landlord, in
which event:

                           (1) Tenant shall retain its termination right and
right to receive the Tenant Termination Amount pursuant to clause (A) of this
Paragraph 1.5.1 if Landlord fails to cause the Land Acquisition, Subdivision,
Grading Commencement or Permit Issuance (as the case may be) to occur by such
extended Acquisition Outside Date, extended Subdivision Outside Date, extended
Grading Commencement Outside Date or extended Permit Issuance Outside Date (as
the case may be);

                           (2) Tenant shall receive one (1) day of abated Fixed
Rent and Real Property Taxes for each day that is within the period commencing
as of the originally scheduled Acquisition Outside Date and expiring upon the
date the Land Acquisition actually occurs;

                           (4) Tenant shall receive one (1) day of abated Fixed
Rent and Real Property Taxes for each date that is within the period commencing
as of the originally scheduled Grading Commencement Outside Date (as the same
may be extended pursuant to Paragraph 1.5.4 below) and expiring upon the date
Grading Commencement actually occurs; and

                           (5) Tenant shall receive one (1) day of abated Fixed
Rent and Real Property Taxes for each day that is within the period commencing
as of the originally scheduled Permit Issuance Outside Date (as the same may be
extended pursuant to Paragraph 1.5.4 below) and expiring upon the date the
Permit Issuance actually occurs.

                  1.5.2    If Landlord fails to deliver possession of the
Premises to Tenant in the Delivery Condition by May 1, 2005 (the "DELIVERY
DEADLINE DATE"), as such date may be extended as provided in Paragraph 1.5.4
below, then in addition to Tenant's other rights and remedies set forth in this
Lease, Tenant may, at any time thereafter but prior to delivery of possession of
the Premises to Tenant in the Delivery Condition, either (i) terminate this
Lease upon not less than ten (10) days' prior written notice to Landlord and
receive from Landlord the Tenant Termination Amount, or (ii) extend the Delivery
Deadline Date to a later date as designated by Tenant in its sole and absolute
discretion in a written notice delivered by Tenant to Landlord, in which event:
(A) Tenant shall retain its termination right and right to receive the Tenant
Termination Amount pursuant to clause (i) of this Paragraph 1.5.2 if Landlord
fails to deliver possession of the Premises to Tenant in the Delivery Condition
by such extended Delivery Deadline Date; and (B) Tenant shall receive one (1)
day of abated Fixed Rent and Real Property Taxes for each day that is within the

                  1.5.3    If Landlord fails to cause the Premises to be Ready
for Occupancy by August 1, 2005 (the "READY FOR OCCUPANCY OUTSIDE DATE"), as
such date may be extended as provided in Paragraph 1.5.4 below, then in addition
to Tenant's other rights and remedies set forth in this Lease, Tenant may, at
any time thereafter prior to Landlord causing the Premises to be Ready for
Occupancy, either (i) terminate this Lease upon not less than ten (10) days'
prior written notice to Landlord and receive from Landlord the Tenant
Termination Amount, or (ii) extend the Ready for Occupancy Outside Date to a
later date as designated by Tenant in its sole and absolute discretion in a
written notice delivered by Tenant to Landlord, in which event: (A) Tenant shall
retain its termination right and right to receive the Tenant Termination Amount
pursuant to clause (i) of this Paragraph 1.5.3 if Landlord fails to cause the
Premises to be Ready for Occupancy by such extended Ready for Occupancy Outside
Date; and (B) Tenant shall receive one (1) day of abated Fixed Rent and Real
Property Taxes for each day that is within the period commencing as of the
originally scheduled Ready for Occupancy Outside Date (as the same may be
extended pursuant to Paragraph 1.5.4 below) and expiring upon the date Landlord
actually causes the Premises to be Ready for Occupancy.

                  1.5.4    Notwithstanding anything in this Paragraph 1.5 to the
contrary, if Grading Commencement, Permit Issuance, delivery of possession of
the Premises to Tenant in the Delivery Condition and/or causing the Premises to
be Ready for Occupancy shall be delayed by reason of (i) any Tenant Delays,
and/or (ii) "FORCE MAJEURE DELAYS", which are defined herein, collectively, as
delays due to governmental regulations, unavailability of material or labor,
rain or other inclement weather, acts of God, strikes, lockouts or any other
matters beyond Landlord's reasonable control (other than Landlord's financial
condition), including delays in obtaining applicable permits from the
governmental authorities beyond the normal period of time for issuance of such
permits for similar projects and not due to Landlord's failure to comply with
the provisions of this Lease or the requirements of such governmental
authorities for issuance of such permits, then the Grading Commencement Outside
Date, the Permit Issuance Outside Date, the Delivery Deadline Date or the Ready
for Occupancy Outside Date (as the case may be) shall be extended for a period
equal to the duration of such Tenant Delays and Force Majeure Delays.
Notwithstanding the foregoing to the contrary, (A) such extension of any of such
four (4) dates for any Force Majeure Delays described in clause (ii) hereinabove
shall not exceed a period of two (2) months nor result in the Ready for
Occupancy Outside Date being extended, in any event, beyond the date which is
eighteen (18) months after the date of execution of this Lease, and (B) no such
extension shall occur to the extent such Force Majeure Delays and/or Tenant
Delays could have been avoided had Landlord used reasonable efforts to avoid
such delay and to adapt and compensate for such delay. In addition, no Tenant
Delay or Force Majeure Delay shall be deemed to have occurred unless Landlord
has delivered to Tenant written notice specifying in reasonable detail the
actions, inactions or circumstances Landlord claims constitute such Tenant Delay
or Force Majeure Delay within five (5) business days after Landlord becomes
aware of the occurrence of the action, inactions or circumstances; provided,
however, in the event Landlord provides such notice after the expiration of that
fifth (5th) business day, the Tenant Delay or Force Majeure Delay (as the case
may be) shall be deemed to have occurred commencing on the day that Landlord
actually provides such notice to Tenant; and provided, further, that no such
Tenant Delay shall be deemed to have occurred if Tenant cures the action,
inaction or circumstance which Landlord claims constitutes such Tenant Delay
within two (2) business days after such notice is received by Tenant (however,
Tenant shall only be entitled to an aggregate of fifteen (15) business days in
which to cure any such actions, inactions or circumstances, and any

                                      -7-

such Tenant Delays occurring after such fifteen (15) business days of aggregate
cure days utilized by Tenant shall be deemed to have occurred without taking
into account any subsequent cure periods hereinabove).

                  1.5.5    Following any such termination of this Lease pursuant
to this Paragraph 1.5, Paragraph 1.2 above or Paragraph 16.1 below, both parties
hereto shall be freed and discharged of all further obligations under this
Lease, except: (i) as provided for in provisions of this Lease which by their
terms survive the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease; (ii) Landlord
shall remain obligated to disburse any undisbursed Tenant Improvement Allowance
to pay for any costs for which the Tenant Improvement Allowance may be utilized
and which have been incurred prior to the effective date of such termination,
subject to and in accordance with the provisions of Exhibit C; and (iii)
Landlord shall reimburse Tenant an amount (the "TENANT TERMINATION AMOUNT")
equal to Tenant's actual, documented and reasonable out-of pocket costs paid or
incurred by Tenant in connection with (A) this Lease (including, without
limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees paid by Tenant in negotiating this
Lease), (B) the design, permitting and construction of the Premises, and/or (C)
the design, acquisition and installation of any improvements, fixtures,
furniture and equipment for the Premises (but only to the extent any of the
foregoing costs have not previously reimbursed or paid by Landlord from the
Tenant Improvement Allowance or otherwise). The Tenant Termination Amount shall
be paid by Landlord to Tenant within thirty (30) days following the effective
date of termination. The foregoing provisions of this Paragraph 1.5.5 shall
survive the termination of this Lease.

         1.6      Rentable Area of the Building.

                  1.6.1    Rentable Area. For purposes hereof, the "RENTABLE
AREA" of the Building shall mean the gross building area of the Building
measured by the drip line of the Building (i.e., the lines that form the
exterior perimeter of the Building and follow the most exterior drip line at the
perimeter of the roof systems of the Building at floor level), but excluding:
(i) any space or areas which are not roofed and/or fully enclosed (including,
without limitation, (A) unenclosed connecting links or area ways, (B) unenclosed
exterior staircases or fire escapes, and (C) unenclosed shipping/receiving
platforms; (ii) any mezzanine or office space or second (2nd) floor space; (iii)
any canopies, exterior steps, exterior landings and staging platforms; and (iv)
any projections that do not extend vertically for the full height of the
Building. The Rentable Area of the Building to be constructed by Landlord is
approximately as set forth on page 1 of this Lease and is the parties' good
faith estimate thereof as of the date of execution of this Lease. Simultaneously
with Landlord's delivery of possession of the Premises to Tenant in the Delivery
Condition, Landlord will cause Landlord's Architect (as defined in Exhibit C) to
certify to Landlord and Tenant the Rentable Area of the Building. Such
certification shall be subject to the reasonable approval of Tenant pursuant to
Paragraph 1.6.2 below. The approved Rentable Area of the Building will be
specified in a Commencement Certificate (as defined in Paragraph 1.7 below), and
the Fixed Rent and Tenant Improvement Allowance shall be adjusted accordingly.

                  1.6.2    Tenant's Remeasurement Right. Within twenty (20) days
after delivery of Landlord's Architect's certificate of Rentable Area of the
Building pursuant to Paragraph 1.6.1 above, Tenant shall approve or disapprove
of that determination, and during such period shall have the right to engage
another California licensed architect experienced in the design and

                                      -8-

construction of industrial buildings to measure the Rentable Area of the
Building. If Landlord's and Tenant's respective determinations differ, and the
parties are unable to resolve the differences within ten (10) business days
after submission of Tenant's determination to Landlord, the dispute shall be
determined by a third California licensed architect selected by Tenant's
architect and Landlord's Architect. If Tenant's architect and Landlord's
Architect are unable to agree on a third architect within twenty (20) days after
the submission of Tenant's determination to Landlord, the Rentable Area of the
Building shall be determined by a third (3rd) California licensed architect
selected by the presiding judge of the Superior Court of Riverside or San
Bernardino County, California, upon application of either Landlord or Tenant.
Tenant's failure to object to Landlord's Architect's determination within the
above 20-day period shall be deemed to be Tenant's approval of the determination
of Landlord's Architect.

         1.7      Commencement Certificate. Within thirty (30) days after the
Commencement Date, Tenant and Landlord shall execute and deliver a "Commencement
Certificate" in the form attached hereto as Exhibit H. In the Commencement
Certificate, Landlord and Tenant shall confirm the Commencement Date, the
Expiration Date of the Term, the Rentable Area of the Building and the Fixed
Rent.

ARTICLE 2: RENTAL.

         2.1      Fixed Rent. Effective upon the Commencement Date, Tenant
shall, except as otherwise provided herein, pay to Landlord as "FIXED RENT"
during the Term of this Lease the sum(s) set forth below in Subparagraph(s)
2.1.1, et seq. Said annual Fixed Rent shall be paid in equal monthly
installments in the amount(s) set forth in said subparagraph(s). Said monthly
Fixed Rent payment shall be paid on the first (1st) day of each full calendar
month for each such month. For periods of less than a full calendar month, said
monthly Fixed Rent payment shall be prorated based on the ratio of the number of
days in such partial calendar month to the total number of days in such full
calendar month. The proportionately reduced Fixed Rent payment for a part of a
calendar month for which Fixed Rent may be due shall be paid at the same time
and together with the Fixed Rent payment for the first (1st) full calendar month
for which Fixed Rent may be due as provided herein.

                  2.1.1    Commencing on the Commencement Date set forth in
Paragraph 2.1 above, and continuing for the next sixty (60) full calendar months
(the "FIRST PERIOD"), the annual Fixed Rent referred to in said Paragraph 2.1
shall be equal to the product of (i) $2.85 and (ii) the Rentable Area of the
Building, to be paid in equal monthly installments equal to the product of (A)
$0.2375 and (B) the Rentable Area of the Building. The Rentable Area of the
Building shall be determined pursuant to Paragraph 1.6 above, and the Fixed Rent
for the First Period shall be calculated based upon such determination as
provided therein.

                  2.1.2    Commencing on the date (the "ADJUSTMENT DATE") which
is the first (1st) day following the last day of the First Period, and
continuing for the remainder of the initial Term of this Lease ("SECOND
PERIOD"), the annual Fixed Rent referred to in said Paragraph 2.1 shall be equal
to the product of (i) the annual amount set forth in Subparagraph 2.1.1 above,
multiplied by (ii) the lesser of (A) 1.10, or (B) a fraction, the numerator of
which is the Comparison Index (as defined in Paragraph 2.1.4 below) for the
Second Period and the

                                      -9-
<PAGE>

BIG 5 WAREHOUSE
RIVERSIDE, CALIFORNIA

denominator of which is the Base Index (as defined in Paragraph 2.1.4 below) for
the Second Period, and shall be paid in equal monthly installments equal to
1/12th of such annual amount.

                  2.1.3    If Tenant extends the initial Term of this Lease for
any of the Option Periods as defined in and pursuant to Paragraph 15.1 hereof,
the annual Fixed Rent referred to in said Paragraph 2.1 and payable by Tenant
during the applicable Option Period shall be equal to the product of (i) the
annual Fixed Rent amount payable during the last year of the immediately
preceding Term of this Lease, multiplied by (ii) the lesser of (A) 1.10, or (B)
a fraction, the numerator of which is the Comparison Index for the applicable
Option Period, as set forth in Paragraph 2.1.4 below, and the denominator of
which is the Base Index for the applicable Option Period, as set forth in
Paragraph 2.1.4 below, and shall be paid in equal monthly installments equal to
1/12th of such annual amount.

                  2.1.4    As used herein: (i) the "INDEX" shall mean the
Consumer Price Index for Los Angeles-Riverside-Orange County, California, All
Urban Consumers, 1982-84=100, as published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics,
United States Department of Labor or any successor agency; (ii) the "COMPARISON
INDEX" shall mean (A) with respect to the Second Period, the Index published for
the calendar month which is three (3) months prior to the Adjustment Date, and
(B) with respect to each applicable Option Period, the Index published for the
calendar month which is three (3) months prior to the commencement date of such
applicable Option Period; and (iii) the "BASE INDEX" shall mean (A) with respect
to the Second Period, the Index published for the calendar month which is three
(3) months prior to the Commencement Date, and (B) with respect to each
applicable Option Period, the Index published for the calendar month which is
sixty-three (63) months prior to the commencement date of such applicable Option
Period.

                  2.1.5    As an illustration of the calculation of the annual
Fixed Rent payable during the Second Period, if the Comparison Index for the
Second Period is 225, the Base Index is 200, and the Rentable Area of the
Building equals 953,132 square feet, then the annual Fixed Rent payable during
the Second Period would equal $2,988,068.82, calculated as follows:
$2,716,426.20 (i.e., the annual Fixed Rent payable for the First Period)
multiplied by 1.10 (which is less than 1.125, the fraction resulting from
dividing the Comparison Index of 225 by the Base Index of 200).

         2.2      Abatement of Rent. If following the Commencement Date Tenant
is prevented from using and does not use any portion of the Building by reason
of (i) default of Landlord, (ii) any labor difficulty encountered by Landlord,
(iii) Landlord's making any repairs or alterations to the Premises, (iv) a
casualty event or eminent domain proceedings, (v) any interruption of any
utilities or services being furnished to the Premises resulting from the acts,
negligence or willful misconduct of Landlord or Landlord's agents, employees,
contractors or licensees, (vi) the existence of Hazardous Materials (as defined
in Paragraph 3.3 below) in, on or at the Premises which have not been (A)
introduced by Tenant or any of Tenant's agents, contractors, employees,
licensees or invitees, and/or (B) caused by the actions of any third parties
(other than Landlord or Landlord's agents, employees or contractors) on the
Premises, or (vii) any other cause beyond the reasonable control of Tenant, then
and in each and all such cases, Tenant may elect, at any time after either (A)
the commencement of such prevention of use with respect to any of the events
described in clauses (i), through (v) hereinabove, or (B) the

                                      -10-

third (3rd) consecutive business day of such prevention of use with respect to
any of the events described in clauses (vi) or (vii) hereinabove, to abate Fixed
Rent, Real Property Taxes payable pursuant to Paragraph 6.1 below and all other
charges payable by Tenant under this Lease for the period that Tenant continues
to be prevented from using, and does not use, the Building or any portion
thereof. Landlord acknowledges that Tenant shall be entitled to such abatement
with respect to any such event described hereinabove which affects areas of the
Premises outside the Building (whether or not the Building is directly affected
thereby), such as, but not limited to, Tenant's inability to use the driveways,
accessways and/or parking areas of the Premises, so long as a result of such
event occurring with respect to such other areas of the Premises, Tenant is
prevented from using and does not use a portion of the Building. Such abatement
shall be in proportion to the Rentable Area of the Building that Tenant is
prevented from using, and does not use (other than for storage purposes), as a
result of any such event; provided, however, if as a result of any event
described in clauses (i) through (vii) hereinabove, less than all of the
Premises or Building is affected by such event but Tenant is nevertheless unable
to effectively conduct its business (other than for storage purposes) from the
remainder of the Building and does not conduct same (other than for storage
purposes) from the area affected by the event and all such remaining portions of
the Building, then the entire Fixed Rent, Real Property Taxes and other charges
payable by Tenant under this Lease shall be abated for such time that Tenant
continues to be so prevented from using, and does not use, the entire Building
for the conduct of its business (other than for storage purposes). If, however,
Tenant reoccupies and recommences its business operations (other than for
storage purposes) from any portion of the Building during such abatement period,
the Fixed Rent, Real Property Taxes and other charges payable by Tenant under
this Lease allocable to such reoccupied portion, based upon the proportion that
the Rentable Area of such reoccupied portion of the Building bears to the total
Rentable Area of the Building, shall be payable by Tenant from the date Tenant
reoccupies such portion of the Building (other than for storage purposes) and
recommences its business operations (other than for storage purposes) therefrom.

         2.3      Place of Payment. Payments of rental hereunder are to be made
pursuant to Paragraph 20.15 hereof.

         2.4      Definition of Rent and Additional Rent. Notwithstanding
anything in this Lease to the contrary, Tenant shall not be obligated to pay to
or reimburse Landlord for any common area or other operating expenses, or
expenses incurred by Landlord for any repairs, maintenance, replacements,
insurance or other services which are Landlord's obligation to perform, provide
or pay for under this Lease (other than reimbursement of Real Property Taxes
pursuant to Paragraph 6.1 below), and Landlord shall not be entitled to receive
any management or administrative fees in connection with the Premises, this
Lease or any such obligations. All sums payable by Tenant to Landlord pursuant
to this Lease other than Fixed Rent shall be deemed to be "ADDITIONAL RENT". The
term "RENT", "RENTS", "RENTAL" or "RENTALS" as used in this Lease shall mean
Fixed Rent and additional rent.

ARTICLE 3: POSSESSION AND TITLE.

         3.1      Landlord's Covenants. Landlord covenants to deliver to Tenant
upon the Delivery Date sole and exclusive possession of the Premises (subject,
however, to Landlord's rights to enter the Premises to complete Landlord's Work
and the Punchlist Items as provided in

Paragraph 1.4 above), free and clear of: (i) all tenants and occupants (other
than Tenant) and the rights of either; (ii) any violations of Applicable Laws;
and (iii) all liens, encumbrances, easements, covenants, conditions and
restrictions (collectively, "ENCUMBRANCES"), except for the following items
(collectively, the "APPROVED TITLE EXCEPTIONS"): (A) those Encumbrances
specified in Exhibit D attached hereto and made a part hereof (collectively, the
"PERMITTED ENCUMBRANCES"); (B) any first priority deed of trust executed by
Landlord as trustor in favor of an institutional lender as beneficiary in
connection with any financing obtained by Landlord to acquire the Land or
construct the Improvements (the "PERMITTED DEED OF TRUST"), subject, however, to
Tenant's receipt of an executed SNDA from such lender pursuant to the provisions
of Article 16 below; and (C) any utility and landscape easements (reasonably
approved by Tenant) that are reasonably necessary to effect the Subdivision,
complete Landlord's Work and/or provide utilities to and for the Premises
(collectively, the "PERMITTED EASEMENTS"). In connection with the foregoing,
Landlord covenants that prior to the earlier of the Delivery Date and the
Outside Subdivision Date, Landlord shall cause all Encumbrances recorded against
the Property (other than the Approved Title Exceptions) to be removed from
record title to the Premises. With respect to any such utility easements
proposed by Landlord pursuant to clause (C) hereinabove, Tenant shall notify
Landlord of Tenant's reasonable approval or disapproval thereof within five (5)
days after Tenant's receipt from Landlord of the documents creating such
proposed easements. Tenant's taking possession of the Premises shall not
constitute a waiver of any defect in the Premises or of any breach by Landlord
of Landlord's obligations under Exhibit C attached hereto.

Landlord further covenants that Landlord will not, so long as this Lease is in
effect:

                  (1)      grant or create (or consent to the granting or
creation of) any leases or occupancy agreements affecting the Premises;

                  (2)      grant or create (or consent to the granting or
creation of) any Encumbrances or other agreements which would or could (x)
adversely affect or interfere with Tenant's access to the Premises, or
materially interfere with Tenant's operation of the Premises for the Permitted

and/or disposed of by Tenant and its agents, contractors, employees, licensees
and invitees as may be required by Applicable Laws. Tenant further acknowledges

obligations contained in this Paragraph 5.4, or if the presence of any Hazardous
Materials in the Building or on or at the Premises, stored, used, generated,
handled and/or disposed of by Tenant or Tenant's agents, contractors, employees,
licensees or invitees results in contamination of the Land, Building or any
other portion of the Premises, then Tenant shall promptly commence and pursue to
completion, at Tenant's expense, a remediation program designed to remediate
such contamination as required by Applicable Laws, provided that Landlord's
approval of such remediation program shall first be obtained (which approval
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). In addition, Tenant

Tenant or Tenant's agents, contractors, employees, licensees or invitees, or (B)
a breach by Tenant of any of its covenants and obligations in this Paragraph
5.4, Tenant shall be solely responsible for the payment of all reasonable costs
of such inspection. Throughout the Term, Tenant shall maintain accurate and

and assessments actually paid for by Tenant. The parties desire that Tenant pay
the Real Property Taxes assessed against the Premises during the Term directly
to the taxing authority. In connection with the foregoing, Landlord covenants
and agrees to: (A) furnish Tenant with true and complete copies of all tax
bills, tax assessment notices and tax statements relating to the Premises
(collectively, the "TAX STATEMENTS") throughout the Term within thirty (30) days
following Landlord's receipt thereof from the applicable taxing authority or
authorities, whether or not such Tax Statements reflect a proposed increase in
assessment or amount of tax; and (B) endeavor to have all Tax Statements for the
Real Property Taxes be issued by the applicable taxing authority directly to
Tenant during the Term (including issued in Tenant's name if necessary for such
purposes). Tenant shall make payment directly to the applicable taxing authority
of the Real Property Taxes assessed against the Premises during the Term of this
Lease in the following manner:

                  (1) in the event Tenant receives the applicable Tax Statements
directly from the applicable taxing authority, Tenant shall make such payment of
the Real Property Taxes evidenced thereby not later than ten (10) days prior to
delinquency; or

                  (2) in the event Tenant does not receive the applicable Tax
Statements directly from the applicable taxing authority, Tenant shall make such
payment of the Real Property Taxes on or before the date which is the later of:
(x) thirty (30) days after receipt by Tenant of written demand by Landlord for
payment thereof (which demand shall include a copy of the proper tax bill
covering such Real Property Taxes); or (y) ten (10) days prior to delinquency.
Notwithstanding the foregoing to the contrary, if the applicable taxing
authority permits payment of Real Property Taxes to be made in installments,
Tenant's obligation to pay Real Property Taxes under this Article 6 shall be
limited to such installment payments.

         6.3      Tenant's Right to Contest. If Tenant desires to contest the
validity of any Real Property Taxes or any other taxes or assessments assessed
against the Premises, it may do so on Landlord's behalf, at Tenant's sole cost
and expense, provided that it shall indemnify Landlord against any loss,
liability or damage on account thereof, excluding lost profits or other
consequential damages. If Tenant is successful in said contest, any refund
received pertaining to any taxes and assessments paid by Tenant shall belong
entirely to Tenant. Landlord agrees to cooperate in a reasonable manner with
Tenant in such contest, including the execution of any documents of
authorization reasonably necessary therefor. Should (i) Landlord at any time
fail to furnish to Tenant true and complete copies of tax bills, tax assessment
notices or tax statements as required by this Article 6 at least thirty (30)
days prior to the date such taxes or assessments are due, and (ii) such failure
results in (A) Tenant's inability to contest (including contest after payment
under protest) any proposed new tax or tax increase, and (B) Tenant's obligation
to pay Real Property Taxes in an amount which is more than the amount paid by
Tenant as Real Property Taxes for the preceding tax year, and Tenant reasonably
establishes that it would have prevailed in such tax contest had such tax bills,
tax assessment notices or tax statements been delivered by such time deadline
set forth hereinabove, then Tenant's obligation for Real Property Taxes for the
tax year for which Tenant was not able to contest shall be limited to the
greater of (1) the amount paid for such purpose for the preceding tax year, or
(2) the

                                      -21-
<PAGE>

BIG 5 WAREHOUSE
RIVERSIDE, CALIFORNIA

amount Tenant reasonably establishes would have been payable had Tenant
prevailed in such tax contest.

         6.4      Liens. Tenant covenants that it will not, during the Term
hereof, suffer or permit any lien to be attached to or upon the Premises by
reason of any act or omission on the part of Tenant, and hereby agrees to
indemnify and hold Landlord harmless from and against any such lien or claim of
lien. In the event any such lien is recorded against the Premises, Tenant shall
have the right to contest the validity of the same, but if the same shall not be
released of record (by payment, posting of a statutory bond or other method)
within thirty (30) days after notice from Landlord to Tenant to do so, Landlord
in its sole discretion, may pay and discharge the same and remove any such lien
from the Premises. Tenant agrees to repay Landlord, upon demand, for any amount
which may have been paid by Landlord in discharging such lien, together with
interest at an annual interest rate equal to the Interest Rate (as defined
below) from the date of the expenditure by Landlord to the date of repayment by
Tenant. As used herein, the "INTEREST RATE" shall mean the lesser of (i) ten
percent (10%) per annum, or (ii) the maximum interest rate allowed by Applicable
Laws.

         6.5      Landlord's Covenant to Pay. Landlord covenants that it will
not fail to pay when due any of the following, if such failure to pay would or
may (i) result in a termination of this Lease, or (ii) adversely affect Tenant's
leasehold interest in the Premises, or (iii) increase Tenant's obligations or
diminish or impair any of Tenant's rights under this Lease: (A) any installment
of taxes, assessments, bonds or other charges upon any mortgage, deed of trust
or other lien or encumbrance affecting the Premises; or (B) any taxes or
assessments payable by Landlord pursuant to this Article 6.

ARTICLE 7: REPAIRS.

         7.1      Tenant's Maintenance and Repair Obligations. During the Term,
but subject to Articles 9 and 12 below, Tenant shall, at Tenant's sole cost and
expense, diligently maintain, repair and replace (as necessary) in good order,
condition and repair, all aspects of the Premises, regardless of the cost
thereof and the time remaining in the Term and whether capital or non-capital,
except for obsolescence and ordinary wear and tear, and unless and to the extent
included in Landlord's obligations under this Lease, including, without
limitation, Paragraphs 5.3, 7.2, 7.3, 9.1 and 12.4 of this Lease (collectively,
"LANDLORD'S MAINTENANCE OBLIGATIONS"). Such obligations of Tenant shall include
(subject to Landlord's Maintenance Obligations), without limitation, all
equipment or facilities serving the Premises, including, mechanical, plumbing,
heating, air conditioning, ventilating and electrical systems (collectively, the
"SYSTEMS"), lighting facilities, interior demising walls, the roof membrane of
the Building (but not the structural components of the roof, and Tenant's repair
obligations shall not include the replacement of the roof or roof membrane or
any part thereof), windows, doors, plate glass, driveways, parking areas,
landscaping, fences, walls, Signs, sidewalks and parkways located in, on or at
the Premises. In addition, Tenant shall maintain the painting of and repaint the
exterior walls of the Building as and when reasonably necessary. Notwithstanding
the foregoing provisions of this Paragraph 7.1 to the contrary, to the extent
any damage to the Premises is caused by the negligence or willful misconduct of
Landlord or any of Landlord's agents, contractors, employees, licensees or
invitees, Landlord shall be solely responsible, at its expense, for repairing
such damage with all due diligence, in good and workmanlike manner, in

                                      -22-
<PAGE>

BIG 5 WAREHOUSE
RIVERSIDE, CALIFORNIA

compliance with all Applicable Laws and in a manner which will not unreasonably
interfere with Tenant's access to or use of the Premises; if Landlord fails to
diligently complete such repairs, or if such repairs are of an emergency nature
which if not attended to may result in bodily injury or property damage or
material interference with or interruption of Tenant's business operations at
the Premises, Tenant may perform such repairs as provided in Paragraph 7.2
below, and Landlord shall reimburse Tenant for the reasonable out-of-pocket
costs incurred by Tenant in performing such repairs within thirty (30) days
after Landlord's receipt of invoices therefor. Landlord agrees that Landlord
will, as part of the cost of the Landlord's Work, obtain for the benefit of both
Landlord and Tenant (i) standard manufacturers' warranties for components of
Landlord's Work, and (ii) warranties against defective construction, workmanship
and materials from the contractors performing the Landlord's Work covering all
of Landlord's Work for a period of at least one (1) year from the date of full
completion of the Landlord's Work, except that with respect to the roof of the
Building, Landlord shall obtain for the benefit of both Landlord and Tenant, as
part of the cost of the Building/Site Work to be paid for by Landlord from
Landlord's own funds, from the subcontractor who installs the roof, a "NO DOLLAR
LIMIT" warranty without proration against defective construction, workmanship
and materials of the roof, covering all materials and labor for a period of at
least fifteen (15) years following the date of full completion of the Landlord's
Work. Landlord hereby assigns to Tenant all of its rights to such warranties and
all other warranties it may now or hereafter have covering those portions of the
Premises which Tenant is responsible to maintain, repair and/or replace, and
Landlord shall provide Tenant such good faith cooperation as is reasonably
necessary to permit enforcement of such warranties by Tenant.

         7.2      Landlord's Maintenance and Repair Obligations. Landlord shall,
at Landlord's sole cost and expense, diligently maintain, repair and replace (as
necessary) in good order, condition and repair: (i) Crest Ridge Drive (unless
such maintenance, repairs and replacements are the City of Riverside's
obligation following any dedication of Crest Ridge Drive to the City of
Riverside); (ii) any other roads, accessways and driveways that are located on
the Land and are made available for the common use of other properties in
addition to the Land (subject to Tenant's approval of any such common use and
the rules and procedures therefor); and (iii) the following elements of the
Building and the other Improvements: (A) the structural components of the roof
of the Building, but excluding the roof membrane, which, except as provided in
Paragraph 7.3 below, shall be Tenant's responsibility to repair as set forth in
Paragraph 7.1 above (provided, however, that in any event, Landlord shall be
responsible, at Landlord's cost, as part of Landlord's Maintenance Obligations,
for replacing the roof and/or roof membrane and any part thereof); (B) floor
slabs; (C) exterior walls (excluding painting thereof which shall be Tenant's
responsibility, as set forth in Paragraph 7.1 above); (D) foundations; (E)
footings; (F) underground utilities; (G) load bearing columns and walls; and (H)
all structural portions (both interior and exterior) thereof. Notwithstanding
the foregoing to the contrary, Tenant shall reimburse Landlord, within thirty
(30) days after receipt of invoices, for the reasonable out-of-pocket costs
incurred by Landlord for (1) repairing any damage to such portions of the
Building and Improvements required to be repaired by Landlord to the extent
caused by the negligence or willful misconduct of Tenant or any of Tenant's
agents, contractors, employees, licensees or invitees, and (2) the replacement
of the roof membrane necessitated solely as a result of Tenant's failure to
maintain the roof membrane as and when required pursuant to Paragraph 7.1 above,
which failure is not cured (or other work performed by Tenant which
substantially corrects the matter) within thirty (30) days after Landlord
notifies Tenant thereof and of Landlord's intent to

                                      -23-
<PAGE>

BIG 5 WAREHOUSE

replace the roof as a result thereof. Landlord shall also repair, at its cost,
any and all damage to the Premises, including fixtures and equipment, which may
result from its failure to make any such maintenance, repairs or replacements
within a reasonable time after being notified by Tenant that such maintenance,
repairs and/or replacements are needed. If any maintenance, repair or
replacement matter for which Landlord is responsible under this Lease
(including, without limitation, under this Article 7) is of an emergency nature
which if not attended to may result in bodily injury or property damage or
material interference with or interruption of Tenant's business operations at
the Premises, Tenant may make such maintenance, repairs or replacements as are
reasonably necessary to remedy such situation without prior notice to Landlord
(provided, however, Tenant shall reasonably attempt to give Landlord oral notice
of such emergency situation prior to taking any such actions, which oral notice
shall be given to the representative of Landlord so designated therefor in
writing to Tenant), and Landlord shall reimburse Tenant for the cost of such
reasonably necessary maintenance, repairs or replacements so undertaken by
Tenant, which reimbursement shall be made within thirty (30) days after
Landlord's receipt of invoices from Tenant evidencing such costs together with a
written statement from Tenant specifying the nature of such emergency situation
and the needed maintenance, repairs or replacements. The obligations of Landlord
under this Article 7 shall not be modified or diminished due to the fact or the
manner in which Tenant shall undertake to make such emergency maintenance,
repairs and/or replacements pursuant to this Paragraph 7.2.

         7.3      Defects; Legally-Mandated Improvements. Landlord shall, at
Landlord's sole cost and expense, diligently make any and all repairs and
replacements of and to the Premises and repair to every part thereof (including
the membrane and other components of the roof of the Building, and all interior
and exterior portions of the Building and other Improvements at the Premises)
which may at any time be necessary by reason of any defects in the original
design and/or construction performed by Landlord or Landlord's contractors
(other than defects in any alterations or improvements installed by Tenant after
the Delivery Date), whether structural or otherwise, and whether capital or
non-capital in nature, and shall repair such defects and any and all damage to
the Premises which may result from any such defects; provided, however, unless
otherwise part of Landlord's maintenance and repair obligations in Paragraph 7.2
above (which provisions shall control with respect to any conflict with this
Paragraph 7.3), Landlord shall not be responsible for correcting any such
defects not disclosed by Tenant in writing to Landlord by the date which is the
later of: (i) ten (10) years (with respect to latent defects) and one (1) year
(with respect to patent defects) after the date of full completion of Landlord's
Work; (ii) ten (10) years (with respect to latent defects) and one (1) year
(with respect to patent defects) after the date such work was initially
installed by Landlord or Landlord's contractors; or (iii) the expiration of the
applicable warranty period under the warranty provided for such work by the
designer and/or contractor performing same. Any addition, alteration or
improvement, structural or otherwise, to or of the Premises, or any part
thereof, which may be necessary or required by reason of any Applicable Laws
promulgated by competent governmental authority shall be governed by the terms
and provisions of Paragraph 5.3 above.

         7.4      Cost and Timing of Repairs. Landlord shall make all
maintenance, repairs and replacements required to be made by it pursuant to this
Article 7: (i) at Landlord's sole cost and expense (and such expenses shall not
be included in any rental, operating expense or other payments required to be
made by Tenant under this Lease); and (ii) promptly following notice from
Tenant, taking into consideration the nature of the maintenance, repair and/or
replacement

                                      -24-

and the inconvenience or interference with Tenant's ability to conduct its
business that failure or delay in performing such work will cause. Landlord
shall also make all such maintenance, repairs and replacements at such times and
in such a manner as to minimize any inconvenience to Tenant in the conduct of
its business.

         7.5      Right of Entry; Posting of Notices. Subject to the provisions
of this Lease, Landlord reserves the right for itself or its duly authorized
agents and representatives at all reasonable times during Tenant's business
hours, but subject to reasonable advance notice, to enter the Premises for the
purpose of inspecting the same or to show the same to any prospective purchaser,
and for the purpose of making any necessary maintenance, repairs and
replacements to the Premises. In conducting any such entries (including any
inspections pursuant to Paragraph 5.4.3 above), Landlord shall follow Tenant's
reasonable security procedures, shall be accompanied by a representative of
Tenant, and shall minimize any inconvenience to Tenant in the conduct of its
business at the Premises. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Tenant may designate
certain areas of the Premises as "secured areas" should Tenant require such
areas for the purposes of securing valuable property or confidential
information; Landlord may not enter such secured areas except in cases of
emergency or otherwise after reasonable advance notice to and approval of Tenant
and only when accompanied by a representative of Tenant. At all reasonable times
Landlord shall have the right to post and keep posted on the Premises any
notices permitted by Applicable Laws relating to Landlord's nonresponsibility
for mechanics liens or liens of a similar nature.

         7.6      Relationship to Article 9. Landlord and Tenant expressly
acknowledge (i) that the foregoing provisions of this Article 7 shall not apply
to any repairs or replacements required as a result of fire or other casualty
event, and (ii) that all repairs and replacements required by fire or other
casualty event shall be governed by the provisions of Article 9 below.

ARTICLE 8: ALTERATIONS; SURRENDER OF PREMISES.

         8.1      Alterations. From and after the Delivery Date, Tenant shall
have the right from time to time to make such additions, repairs, alterations,
changes or improvements, in, on or to the Premises, as Tenant may deem necessary
or proper (including, but not limited to, the installation of trade fixtures,
above and/or below ground storage tanks [subject to Tenant's compliance with the
provisions of Paragraph 5.4 above with respect to such storage tanks], service
bays, equipment, and partitions required or used from time to time in connection
with Tenant's business in the Premises, and Signs and Communication Equipment
described in Article 4 above), subject, however, to the following conditions:
(i) no work done by Tenant shall lessen the market value of the Premises; (ii)
Tenant shall pay promptly for all such work done by it or upon its order subject
to Landlord's contribution of the Tenant Improvement Allowance pursuant to
Exhibit C, to the extent applicable thereto; (iii) Tenant shall construct all
such alterations in compliance with all Applicable Laws and pursuant to a valid
building permit (if required for the work to be performed by Tenant); (iv)
Tenant shall obtain Landlord's prior consent, which shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed, with respect to any such alterations
(including Tenant's Signs and Communication Equipment) (A) made to or affecting
the structural components of the Building, or (B) which adversely affect the
roof or exterior appearance of the Building; (v) if any such work affects the
roof of the Building, Tenant shall perform such work (A) in a manner which will
not void the roof warranty, and (B) if

material in nature, only under the reasonable supervision of Landlord's outside
independent roof consultant (who Landlord shall make reasonably available to
Tenant to permit Tenant to timely perform such work), and Tenant shall reimburse
Landlord for the reasonable fees of such consultant in providing such
supervision services within thirty (30) days after invoice from Landlord; and
(vi) any such work performed after the Delivery Date but prior to the
Commencement Date shall not unreasonably interfere with the completion of
Landlord's Work by Landlord and Landlord's contractors and shall be performed
pursuant to a mutually approved schedule therefor as set forth in Exhibit C. In
the event Landlord's prior consent is required for Tenant's alterations pursuant
to clause (iv) hereinabove, Landlord shall notify Tenant of its approval or
reasonable disapproval within ten (10) days after Tenant's request therefor; if
Landlord fails to notify Tenant of Landlord's approval or disapproval within
such 10-day period, and such failure continues for an additional five (5)
business days after notice thereof from Tenant, Landlord shall be deemed to have
approved the proposed alterations. Nothing contained herein shall be construed
to require Tenant to: (1) remove any alterations or improvements made by or on
behalf of Tenant to or at the Premises, although (x) Tenant shall have the right
to remove any such alterations and/or improvements made by or on behalf of
Tenant, so long as Tenant repairs, at its expense, any damage to the Premises
resulting from such removal, and (y) with respect to any alterations which are
other than Landlord's Work, Landlord may require Tenant to remove same at the
expiration or earlier termination of this Lease so long as Landlord notifies
Tenant of such removal request within ten (10) days after Tenant notifies
Landlord of such alterations work, in which case Tenant, at Tenant's expense,
shall cause such alterations to be removed on or before the expiration or sooner
termination of this Lease and repair any damage to the Premises resulting from
such removal; or (2) make or pay for any repair, alteration, improvement, or
addition, or to do any other act or thing which Landlord is required to make or
do under any provision of this Lease, or which is required or becomes necessary
at any time because of any failure of Landlord to perform any of its obligations
hereunder.

         8.2      Surrender of Premises. Tenant shall, at the expiration of the
Term hereof, surrender the Premises and any improvements and alterations made
thereto not removed or required to be removed by Tenant pursuant to Paragraph
8.1 above, together with any personal property therein belonging to Landlord, in
broom-clean condition.

         8.3      Removal of Tenant's Property. Within ten (10) business days
after the expiration or sooner termination of this Lease, Tenant shall (i)
remove from the Premises all merchandise, trade fixtures, furniture,
furnishings, partitions, equipment and other personal property installed therein
and owned by Tenant or leased by Tenant from third-parties (excluding, however,
at Tenant's option, any Signs installed on or at the Premises), and (ii) repair
any damage to the Premises caused by any such removal.

         8.4      Initial Improvements. The rights and obligations of Landlord
and Tenant with respect to the development and construction of the initial
Improvements and Landlord's Work (and the installation by Tenant of the
Fixturization Work for the Building) are set forth in Exhibit C attached hereto.

ARTICLE 9: DAMAGE OR DESTRUCTION.

         9.1      Landlord's Restoration Obligations.

                  9.1.1    If the Improvements or any other part of the Premises
shall be damaged or destroyed by fire, earthquake or other casualty event or
from any other cause other than ordinary wear and tear, ordinary physical
depreciation or obsolescence, Landlord shall promptly (in any event, within
thirty (30) days following the date Landlord receives notice from Tenant or
otherwise becomes aware of the damage or destruction), notify Tenant in writing
as to how long it will take to substantially restore the damage or destruction
(ignoring any absence of insurance proceeds or delays in receiving the same) as
estimated by a reputable, qualified, licensed, nonaffiliated contractor having
at least ten (10) years experience in the construction and repair of buildings
of similar class, size, quality, design and method of construction as the
Building (the "EXPERIENCED CONTRACTOR"). Landlord's failure to so notify Tenant
within such 30-day period, where such failure continues for an additional ten
(10) days after notice thereof from Tenant shall, if Tenant so chooses, be
deemed to be the Experienced Contractor's determination that such restoration
will take longer than twelve (12) months (measured from the date of the damage
or destruction).

                  9.1.2    Subject to and except as expressly provided in
Paragraphs 9.1.3, 9.2 and 9.3 below, if the Improvements or any other part of
the Premises shall be damaged or destroyed to any extent by fire, earthquake or
other casualty event, Landlord shall, at Landlord's sole cost and expense (but
subject to payment of any Excess Costs [as defined in Paragraph 9.1.3 below], if
applicable, and insurance proceeds therefor from the Property Damage Insurance
[as defined in Paragraph 10.4.1 below] to be placed in the Construction Escrow,
as defined in Paragraph 9.1.3 below, and as provided in Paragraphs 9.1.3 and
10.4.3 below), diligently repair and restore the same to substantially the same
condition existing immediately prior to said damage or destruction with all
reasonable dispatch and diligence as provided herein. Said repair and
restoration shall include all fixtures and equipment in or of the Building and
the Premises owned by Landlord (including, without limitation, the HVAC,
plumbing, electrical and other mechanical and utilities systems and equipment in
and/or serving the Premises) and all leasehold improvements and alterations in
and to the Building and Premises, to the extent so damaged or destroyed.
Landlord shall have no obligation to repair, restore or replace Tenant's stock
in trade, trade fixtures, equipment, furnishings, furniture or other personal
property. All such repair and restoration of the Premises by Landlord shall be
made in accordance with plans and specifications approved by Tenant, which
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Landlord
shall comply, and shall require all its contractors to comply, with all
Applicable Laws in making any said repairs and restoration. Landlord shall
indemnify, defend, protect and hold Tenant harmless from and against any and all
damages, claims, expenses, losses and/or liabilities (excluding lost profits and
other consequential damages) resulting from Landlord's failure to comply with
said Applicable Laws and/or diligently perform such repair and restoration work.
After repair and restoration, Landlord shall return possession of the Premises
to Tenant without diminution in size of the Building or Premises or change of
location, except as required by Applicable Laws. If Landlord carries on any
restoration or repair pursuant to this Article 9 and Tenant continues to occupy
any portion of the Premises, Landlord shall take all such steps as may be
reasonable and practicable to prevent interference with Tenant's use and
enjoyment of the portion of the Premises which Tenant continues to occupy.

                                      -27-

Landlord shall also perform its obligations under this Article 9 in a manner
which will achieve restoration of any damage or destruction as soon as
practicable, giving due regard to the nature and scope of the damage or
destruction.

                  9.1.3    If (i) the Improvements shall be damaged or destroyed
by any fire, earthquake or other casualty event which is not required to be
covered by property damage insurance under Paragraph 10.4 below ("UNINSURED
CASUALTY"), and the cost of repair or restoration of such Uninsured Casualty
damage or destruction exceeds the "THRESHOLD AMOUNT" (which for purposes hereof
shall mean twenty percent (20%) of the full replacement cost of the Improvements
immediately prior to said damage or destruction), or (ii) such damage or
destruction is caused by an earthquake, and Earthquake Insurance Coverage (as
defined in Paragraph 10.4.2 below) is in effect but the cost to repair such
earthquake damage (inclusive of the deductible amounts under such Earthquake
Insurance Coverage) which is not payable from proceeds under such Earthquake
Insurance Coverage exceeds the Threshold Amount, then Landlord may notify Tenant
in writing, within thirty (30) days after determining the repair and restoration
cost (but in no event later than sixty (60) days after said damage or
destruction), that Landlord elects not to restore the Premises or repair said
damage to the extent of such excess ("EXCESS COSTS") and to terminate this Lease
pursuant to the following provisions of this Paragraph 9.1.3. Such notice by
Landlord (herein referred to as "LANDLORD'S TERMINATION NOTICE") shall be
accompanied by an estimate of such replacement cost and at least two (2) bids
prepared by contractors approved by Tenant, showing in detail the costs of the
required repairs or restoration. If, within thirty (30) days after Tenant's
receipt of Landlord's Termination Notice, Tenant notifies Landlord in writing
that Tenant agrees to pay the Excess Costs, then within ten (10) days after
approval by Landlord and Tenant (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) of
joint escrow and payment instructions pertaining to disbursement of funds
covering such repair and restoration costs, Tenant shall place in a joint
construction escrow account held by a bank or escrow company mutually approved
by the parties (the "CONSTRUCTION ESCROW") an amount equal to the Excess Costs,
together with said approved joint escrow and payment instructions. Landlord
shall thereafter with all reasonable dispatch and diligence, and at Landlord's
expense (but with the right to recover such Excess Costs from the Construction
Escrow pursuant to such approved joint escrow and payment instructions), make
all the necessary repairs or restoration in accordance with Paragraph 9.1.2
above, and this Lease shall continue in effect. The cost of the Construction
Escrow holder's fees for such Construction Escrow shall be shared and paid
equally by the parties. If Tenant fails to either (A) notify Landlord in writing
within thirty (30) days after Tenant's receipt of Landlord's Termination Notice
that Tenant agrees to pay the Excess Costs, or (B) deposit the Excess Costs
together with said approved joint escrow and payment instructions within such
ten (10) day period set forth hereinabove, then this Lease shall terminate at
the end of said thirty (30) day period set forth in clause (A) hereinabove or
said ten (10) day period set forth in clause (A) hereinabove, as the case may be
(but Tenant shall have up to ninety (90) days after such termination to vacate
and surrender possession of the Premises to Landlord), and the provisions of
Paragraph 9.5 below shall apply. If Landlord shall fail to notify Tenant of
Landlord's election not to repair the damage or restore the Premises to the
extent of the Excess Costs within ninety (90) days after such damage or
destruction, Landlord shall make all necessary repairs or restoration at
Landlord's sole cost and expense (subject to payment of any insurance proceeds
from the Property Damage Insurance to be placed in the Construction Escrow
pursuant to Paragraph 10.4.3 below), in accordance with Paragraph 9.1.2 above.

                  9.1.4    During the period of any such damage, destruction,
restoration and repair, Landlord shall reasonably cooperate with Tenant to
provide Tenant with temporary space for the operation of Tenant's Permitted Use
therein within Landlord's existing buildings, if any, located in San Bernardino
County or Riverside County, California, to the extent such space is available,
in which case Tenant shall pay Landlord for the use of such temporary space so
provided prevailing market rent, taxes and operating costs for such temporary
space in such amounts as shall be mutually and reasonably approved by the
parties.

         9.2      Tenant's Termination Right. Notwithstanding the provisions of
Paragraph 9.1 above to the contrary, in the event that the Experienced
Contractor reasonably determines that substantial restoration of the damage or
destruction resulting from any fire, earthquake or other casualty event will
take longer than twelve (12) months (measured from the date of the damage or
destruction), Tenant may terminate this Lease by written notice to Landlord
within thirty (30) days following Tenant's receipt of the Experienced
Contractor's determination (or within thirty (30) days following the expiration
of the thirty (30) day period set forth in Paragraph 9.1.1 above for Landlord to
provide the Experienced Contractor's determination to Tenant, in the event such
Experienced Contractor's determination is not timely delivered). Such
termination shall be effective as of the date specified by Tenant in Tenant's
termination notice, which shall be not sooner than thirty (30) days nor later
than ninety (90) days after such termination notice is delivered to Landlord.

         9.3      Damage Near End of Term. Anything in this Article 9 to the
contrary notwithstanding, if the Improvements or any other part of the Premises
shall be destroyed or damaged during the last twelve (12) months of the Term
hereof by reason of any fire, earthquake or other casualty event, and the
Premises cannot be substantially restored within a period of sixty (60) working
days from the date of such damage or destruction, this Lease may be terminated
upon written notice by either party to the other. Provided, however, that if at
the time of said destruction or damage, Tenant has an unexercised right of
extension pursuant to Article 15 hereof which is still in effect, Landlord may
not terminate this Lease until it has given Tenant notice of its intent to
terminate and Tenant fails to exercise said right of extension within thirty
(30) days of receipt of said notice. If Tenant fails to exercise said right of
extension, this Lease shall terminate effective thirty (30) days after Tenant's
receipt of said notice from Landlord.

         9.4      Failure to Commence or Complete Restoration. Anything in this
Article 9 to the contrary notwithstanding, if the repair and restoration
provided for in Paragraph 9.1 hereof is not commenced within six (6) months from
the date of the damage or destruction referred to in said Paragraph, or once
commenced, if said repair or restoration is not completed within the later of
(i) twelve (12) months after the date of such damage or destruction or (ii) the
estimated restoration period originally determined by the Experienced Contractor
pursuant to Paragraph 9.1.1 above, Tenant may terminate this Lease upon written
notice to Landlord, which termination shall be effective as of the date
specified by Tenant in such termination notice which shall be not sooner than
thirty (30) nor later than ninety (90) days after such termination notice is
delivered to Landlord. Tenant's right to terminate this Lease as provided
hereinabove (and elsewhere in this Article 9) shall be in addition to any other
right or remedy Tenant may have arising out of Landlord's breach of any covenant
of this Lease.

above in this Article 9, such destruction or damage to the Premises shall not
terminate this Lease, notwithstanding the provisions of California Civil Code
Sections 1932 and 1933 or any other Applicable Laws to the contrary. Upon any
such termination of this Lease by Landlord or Tenant pursuant to this Article 9,

expressly survive such termination.

         9.6      Conflict with Article 8. Wherever the provisions of this

possession of the Premises to Tenant in the Delivery Condition as provided in
Paragraph 1.1 hereof and throughout the Term of this Lease, Tenant shall
maintain in force a commercial general liability insurance policy or policies
for liability for personal injury, death and bodily injury to persons and damage
to property occurring upon, within or at the Premises and arising from Tenant's
use and/or occupancy of the Premises. Said insurance policy or policies shall
name Landlord as an additional insured and shall be in an amount of not less
than a combined single limit liability of Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000.00),
with a commercially reasonable deductible or self-insured retention amount
(currently Tenant proposes an initial self-insured retention amount of
$250,000.00, which Landlord agrees is commercially reasonable). Said insurance
policy or policies shall be primary and noncontributing with any insurance
maintained by Landlord and shall include a blanket contractual liability
endorsement.

         10.2     Tenant's Personal Property Insurance. From the date Landlord
delivers possession of the Premises to Tenant in the Delivery Condition as
provided in Paragraph 1.1 hereof and throughout the Term of this Lease, Tenant
shall maintain in force an insurance policy covering all perils generally
included within the classification "Special Form - Risks of Direct Physical
Loss", other than earthquake or flood, with an extended coverage endorsement, in
the amount of not less than one hundred percent (100%) of the full replacement
cost of all of Tenant's trade fixtures, equipment, inventory and other personal
property owned by Tenant at the Premises. Landlord shall have no interest in or
claim of any nature to the proceeds of any such insurance.

         10.3     Landlord's Liability Insurance. At Landlord's expense,
Landlord shall maintain in force from and after the date of execution of this

insurance policy or policies for liability for personal injury, death and bodily
injury to persons and damage to property occurring upon, within or at the
Premises and arising out of Landlord's acts or omissions, including, without

Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000), with a commercially reasonable deductible.
Said insurance policy or policies shall be primary and noncontributing with any

         10.4     Property Damage Insurance.

                  10.4.1   From the date Landlord delivers possession of the
Premises to Tenant in the Delivery Condition as provided in Paragraph 1.1 hereof
and continuing thereafter throughout the Term of this Lease, Tenant shall, at
its sole cost and expense, maintain in force an insurance policy or policies
covering: (i) all perils generally included within the classification "Special
Form - Risks of Direct Physical Loss", other than earthquake or flood, with an
extended coverage endorsement, in the amount of not less than one hundred
percent (100%) of the full replacement cost (with a commercially reasonable
deductible) of the Building and all other Improvements within or on the
Premises, and all improvements, alterations, fixtures and equipment within the
Building and any such other Improvements, exclusive, however, of trade fixtures,
inventory and other personal property owned by Tenant, and exclusive of the
value of excavations, underground utilities, foundations and footings; and (ii)
earthquake damage to such property described in clause (i) hereinabove, in such
amounts and upon such terms as Tenant shall determine, subject, however, to the
limitations contained in Paragraph 10.4.2 below. The insurance described in this
Paragraph 10.4.1 shall sometimes be referred to herein as the "PROPERTY DAMAGE
INSURANCE."

                  10.4.2   Landlord and Tenant agree that the obligation of
Tenant to provide insurance coverage for the Building and all other Improvements
at the Premises against damage from earthquake ("EARTHQUAKE INSURANCE COVERAGE")
shall be subject to the following additional terms, conditions and limitations:

                  (i)      The deductible for Earthquake Insurance Coverage, so
long as Earthquake Insurance Coverage is required to be maintained in accordance
with this Paragraph 10.4.2, shall be the deductible amount which is generally
commercially available for Earthquake Insurance Coverage with a premium not in
excess of $0.25 per square foot of Rentable Area of the Building per year (the
"MAXIMUM EARTHQUAKE PREMIUM").

                  (ii)     Tenant shall not be required to carry Earthquake
Insurance Coverage if (A) the premium payable for Earthquake Insurance Coverage
will exceed the Maximum Earthquake Premium, and (B) following notice by Tenant
to Landlord of such election not to carry such Earthquake Insurance Coverage
pursuant to Paragraph 10.4.2(ii) below, neither Tenant nor Landlord elects to
pay such excess in accordance with Paragraph 10.4.2(iii) below. If Earthquake
Insurance Coverage becomes unobtainable, regardless of the premium amount, or if
Tenant otherwise determines in good faith that Earthquake Insurance Coverage is
not available with coverage limits, deductibles, exclusions and other terms and
conditions that are commercially reasonable or otherwise reasonably acceptable
to Tenant, then Tenant shall have the right to allow Earthquake Insurance
Coverage to lapse upon expiration of the Earthquake Insurance Coverage then in
effect by providing Landlord written notice of such election at least fifteen
(15) days prior to the date such coverage will lapse. Landlord shall thereafter
have the right to maintain Earthquake Insurance Coverage (if obtainable) at
Landlord's expense, subject to reimbursement by Tenant of the premiums paid for
by Landlord in obtaining such Earthquake Insurance Coverage, but such
reimbursement obligation shall not exceed the Maximum Earthquake Premium.

                  (iii)    If, at any time from the date Landlord delivers
possession of the Premises to Tenant in the Delivery Condition and continuing
thereafter throughout the Term, the premium for Earthquake Insurance Coverage
will exceed the Maximum Earthquake Premium, Tenant shall have the right, at its
option, to elect either to (A) pay the portion of the proposed premium for
Earthquake Insurance Coverage in excess of the Maximum Earthquake Premium, and
thereby maintain Earthquake Insurance Coverage in effect, or (B) elect not to
pay such excess and allow Earthquake Insurance Coverage for the Premises to
lapse. If Tenant has the right to make the election described in the immediately
preceding sentence, Tenant shall give written notice to Landlord (herein
"TENANT'S ELECTION NOTICE") of the action intended by Tenant at least fifteen
(15) days prior to the date such coverage will lapse. If, in Tenant's Election
Notice, Tenant informs Landlord that it has elected to allow Earthquake
Insurance Coverage to lapse, Landlord shall have the right, within ten (10) days
after receipt of Tenant's Election Notice, by giving written notice to Tenant,
to cause Tenant to maintain Earthquake Insurance Coverage in effect by agreeing
to pay to Tenant, without reimbursement from Tenant, the full amount of the
excess (which payment shall be made within ten (10) business days after invoice
for such excess is delivered by Tenant to Landlord). If Landlord fails to timely
pay such excess, Tenant shall nevertheless have the right to allow the
Earthquake Insurance Coverage to lapse.

                  10.4.3   Tenant and Landlord (and any mortgagee of Landlord
with a first mortgage or first deed of trust encumbering the Premises of whom
Landlord has notified Tenant in writing) shall be loss payees of the Property
Damage Insurance maintained pursuant to this Paragraph 10.4, as their respective
interests may appear; however, any and all proceeds of such Property Damage
Insurance shall be deposited into the Construction Escrow to be established by
the parties pursuant to Paragraph 9.1.3 above and shall be used to pay for the
costs of the repair and restoration of the Premises as provided by Paragraph 9.1
hereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing to the contrary, if this Lease is
terminated pursuant to the provisions of Article 9 above as a result of any such
damage or destruction, Tenant shall be entitled to receive and retain the
following insurance proceeds (collectively, the "TENANT'S TERMINATION INSURANCE
PROCEEDS"): (i) all insurance proceeds pertaining to any leasehold improvements
or alterations at the Premises made by Landlord or Tenant from Tenant's own
funds; and (ii) all insurance proceeds pertaining to any leasehold improvements
or alterations at the Premises made by Landlord or Tenant from the Tenant
Improvement Allowance, but only with respect to any termination of this Lease
pursuant to this Article 10 which occurs after the initial 10-year Term of this
Lease. If by reason of the provisions of any first mortgage or first deed of
trust executed by Landlord on the Premises, Property Damage Insurance proceeds
are required to be made payable to the lien holder, Tenant hereby consents
thereto, provided that the lien holder in question (A) shall first agree in
writing with Landlord and Tenant to make such proceeds available for the repair
and restoration of the Premises to the extent required pursuant to Paragraph 9.1
hereof, and (B) shall not have any interest in the Tenant's Termination
Insurance Proceeds, and Tenant shall not be required to cause Tenant's
Termination Insurance Proceeds to be delivered to such lien holder.

         10.5     Rent Loss Insurance. From the date Landlord delivers
possession of the Premises to Tenant in the Delivery Condition as provided in
Paragraph 1.1 hereof and throughout the Term of this Lease, Tenant shall, at
Tenant's expense, maintain in force rent loss insurance for the benefit of the
Landlord as loss payee covering loss of rental income under this Lease for a
period of twelve (12) months.

         10.6     Waiver of Subrogation. Landlord and Tenant shall each procure
from each of the insurers under all policies of property damage insurance
obtained pursuant to the provisions of this Article 10, a waiver of all rights
of subrogation which said insurer might otherwise have, as against the other
party hereto, said waiver to be in writing and for the express benefit of the
other. Landlord and Tenant hereby release each other and waive any claim against
the other relating to losses or liabilities for which the releasing party is
obligated to obtain property damage insurance under the provisions of this
Article 10. For purposes of the preceding sentence, Landlord and Tenant shall
include the directors, officers and employees of each.

         10.7     General Insurance Requirements. Any and all insurance policies
obtained by either Landlord or Tenant pursuant to the provisions of this Article
10 shall be issued only by a responsible insurer, properly licensed in the State
of California, having a rating of not less than A-/VII in Best's Insurance
Guide. Each such insurance policy shall include an endorsement obligating the
insurer to give the party hereto not obtaining said insurance policy thirty (30)
days' prior written notice of any cancellation or change in scope or amount of
coverage of such insurance policy. Each party hereto shall cause to be issued to
the other party appropriate certificates of insurance evidencing compliance with
the terms of the provisions of this Article 10 relating to insurance; Tenant
shall provide Landlord with such certificates for Tenant's insurance at least
ten (10) business days prior to the date Landlord delivers possession of the
Premises to Tenant in the Delivery Condition.

         10.8     Blanket Policies. Notwithstanding anything in this Article 10
to the contrary, Tenant and Landlord may each insure for the amount of any
insurance required to be carried by it pursuant to this Article 10 under a
blanket and/or umbrella policy or policies covering other liabilities of the
insuring party and/or its subsidiaries, controlling or affiliated entities.

         10.9     Indemnities. Notwithstanding anything in this Article 10 to
the contrary:

                  10.9.1   Tenant shall indemnify, defend, protect and hold
harmless Landlord and Landlord's managers, members, partners, officers,
directors, agents and employees (collectively, "LANDLORD'S REPRESENTATIVES")
from and against any and all liabilities, losses, costs, expenses and claims,
including reasonable attorneys' fees, but specifically excluding lost profits
and other consequential damages (collectively, "CLAIMS") to the extent (i)
resulting from an incident (A) which occurs at the Premises from and after the
date Landlord delivers possession of the Premises, Ready for Occupancy, to
Tenant as provided in Paragraph 1.4 above, and which results in bodily injury,
death or property damage, or (B) which arises out of the negligence or willful
misconduct of Tenant and/or Tenant's employees, contractors, agents and/or
licensees, and (ii) not insured or required to be insured against by Landlord
under this Lease; provided however, the foregoing indemnity shall not include
any Claims to the extent resulting from the negligence or willful misconduct of
Landlord or any of Landlord's Representatives.

                  10.9.2   Landlord shall indemnify, defend, protect and hold
harmless Tenant and Tenant's managers, members, partners, officers, directors,
agents and employees (collectively, "TENANT'S REPRESENTATIVES") from and against
any and all Claims to the extent (i) resulting from an incident (A) which occurs
at the Premises at any time prior to the date Landlord delivers possession of
the Premises, Ready for Occupancy, to Tenant as provided in Paragraph 1.4 above
and which results in bodily injury, death or property damage or (B) which arises
out of the

negligence or willful misconduct of Landlord and/or Landlord's employees,
contractors, agents and/or licensees, and (ii) not insured or required to be
insured against by Tenant under this Lease; provided however, the foregoing
indemnity shall not include any Claims to the extent resulting from the
negligence or willful misconduct of Tenant or any of Tenant's Representatives.

                  10.9.3   The foregoing mutual indemnities are intended to be
consistent with the waivers as set forth in Paragraph 10.6 above, pursuant to
which each party (i) has waived its respective rights against the other party to
the extent any losses, damages or other Claims are insured or required to be
insured under property damage policies by such party pursuant to the provisions
of this Lease, and (ii) has agreed to cause such party's respective insurance
carrier to include a waiver of subrogation in their respective property damage
insurance policies. In addition, the foregoing indemnities, and the waivers set
forth in Paragraph 10.6 above, are not intended to and shall not relieve any
insurance carrier of its obligations to provide insurance coverage pursuant to
insurance policies obtained pursuant to the provisions of this Lease.

                  10.9.4   In the event any action or proceeding is brought
against Landlord or any of Landlord's Representatives and such claim is a claim
from which Tenant is obligated to indemnify Landlord or Landlord's
Representatives pursuant to this Paragraph, Tenant, upon notice from Landlord,
shall resist and defend such action or proceeding (in the case of a lawsuit, by
legal counsel reasonably satisfactory to Landlord). In the event any action or
proceeding is brought against Tenant or any of Tenant's Representatives and such
claim is a claim from which Landlord is obligated to indemnify Tenant or
Tenant's Representatives pursuant to this Paragraph, Landlord, upon notice from
Tenant, shall resist and defend such action or proceeding (in the case of a
lawsuit, by legal counsel reasonably satisfactory to Tenant).

                  10.9.5   Notwithstanding anything in this Lease, including
without limitation this Paragraph 10.9 or Articles 17 or 18 below, to the
contrary, the terms of this Lease shall not impose any obligation on either
party to be responsible or liable for the other party's lost profits or other
consequential damages. Landlord and Tenant agree that Landlord's right to
recover future rent under California Civil Code Section 1951.2 upon a
termination of this Lease following a default by Tenant pursuant to Paragraph
17.1 below shall not be deemed consequential damages or lost profits for
purposes of this Paragraph 10.9.5.

                  10.9.6   The obligations of the parties under this Paragraph
10.9 shall survive termination of this Lease.

ARTICLE 11: ASSIGNMENT AND SUBLETTING.

         11.1     Tenant's Right to Assign or Sublet. Subject to Paragraphs 11.2
and 11.3 below, Tenant shall have the right, with Landlord's prior written
consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or conditioned, to
assign this Lease or sublet the Premises or any part thereof. If Tenant desires
to assign this Lease or sublet the Premises or any part thereof other than
pursuant to Paragraphs 11.2 or 11.3 below, Tenant shall notify Landlord of such
proposed assignment or sublease specifying the identity of the proposed assignee
or subtenant and the material terms of the proposed assignment or sublease
(which material terms may be evidenced by a letter of intent, correspondence
between the parties or other means designated by Tenant);

                                      -34-

Landlord shall have a period of twenty (20) days following receipt of such
notice to notify Tenant of Landlord's approval of the proposed assignment or
sublease, or reasonable disapproval (with the reasons for such disapproval
specified in detail). If Landlord fails to notify Tenant in writing of the
approval or reasonable disapproval within such twenty (20) day period, Landlord
shall be deemed to have consented to such proposed assignment or sublease.

         11.2     Consent to Partial Subletting. Notwithstanding anything in
this Article 11 to the contrary, Landlord hereby agrees that Tenant may, at any
time and from time to time without having to obtain Landlord's prior consent,
sublet up to an aggregate of fifty percent (50%) of the Building and Premises,
whenever in the opinion of Tenant it shall be advisable to sublet any such
portions of the Building and Premises.

         11.3     Consent to Transfers to Tenant Affiliates. Notwithstanding
anything in this Article 11 to the contrary, Landlord hereby agrees that Tenant
may, at any time and from time to time without having to obtain Landlord's prior
consent, assign, sublet or transfer this Lease or the Premises or any part
thereof to any entity which owns or controls Tenant, to any entity owned or
controlled by Tenant, to any entity owned or controlled by or affiliated with
any entity which owns or controls Tenant, or to any entity resulting from a
consolidation, or to the surviving entity in case of a merger, to which
consolidation or merger Tenant shall be a party, or to an entity to which all or
substantially all of the assets of Tenant have been sold. In addition, Landlord
hereby agrees that any transfer or series of transfers of stock or other
ownership interests in Tenant whether or not resulting in a change in the
controlling interest in Tenant and whether voluntarily, by operation of law or
otherwise, shall not be deemed an assignment, subletting or other transfer of
Tenant's interest in this Lease or the Premises and thus shall not be subject to
the requirement that Tenant notify Landlord thereof or obtain Landlord's prior
consent thereto.

         11.4     No Release. No such assignment, subletting or transfer of this
Lease by Tenant pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Article 11 shall
release Tenant from Tenant's obligations under this Lease.

ARTICLE 12: EMINENT DOMAIN.

         12.1     Total Taking. In the event of a "TOTAL TAKING", defined as
when the entire Premises or the entire Building is taken or appropriated under
the power of eminent domain, this Lease shall terminate as of the date of the
taking of physical possession of the Premises or Building (as the case may be),
and each party shall be released from any liability accruing thereafter under
this Lease (but shall not be released from any liability accruing prior to such
termination).

         12.2     Partial Taking.

                  12.2.1 In the event that through such eminent domain
proceedings there is a "PARTIAL TAKING", defined as when only a portion or
portions of the Building or Premises is taken, and Tenant in good faith
determines that such taking may have a material adverse effect on its ability to
conduct its business in the Premises, Tenant shall have the option (exercisable
by written notice to Landlord at any time within sixty (60) days after the
taking of physical possession under any such proceeding) to terminate this Lease
effective as of the later of (i) the

                                      -35-

termination date set forth in Tenant's termination notice, which shall be no
later than the ninetieth (90th) day following such notice, or (ii) the day
before the date of the taking of physical possession of such portion(s) of the
Premises. Upon any such termination, each party shall be released from any
liability accruing thereafter under this Lease (but shall not be released from
any liability accruing prior to such termination). Except as provided in this
Article 12, such Partial Taking shall not be a basis to terminate this Lease,
notwithstanding any Applicable Laws of the State of California to the contrary.

                  12.2.2 Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of Paragraph
12.2.1 to the contrary, in the event Landlord disputes that such taking would
have a material adverse effect on Tenant's ability to conduct its business at
the Premises and thus disputes the effectiveness of Tenant's exercise of its
right to terminate this Lease pursuant to Paragraph 12.2.1 above, then the
parties agree to resolve the dispute as provided in this Paragraph 12.2.2. Prior
to submitting any such dispute to JAMS arbitration (as provided below), Landlord
and Tenant agree that they shall meet and use good faith efforts, for a period
of fifteen (15) days, to attempt to resolve such dispute. If the parties fail to
resolve such dispute within said 15-day period, the parties agree to submit the
question to binding arbitration by the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation
Services ("JAMS") in Riverside County, California, in accordance with the
Comprehensive Arbitration Rules of JAMS, or the Streamlined Arbitration Rules of
JAMS if mutually agreed to by both parties hereunder. The parties agree to
cooperate with JAMS and with one another in selecting from JAMS' panel of
arbitrators (selecting, if available, an arbitrator experienced in commercial
real estate matters in Riverside County, California) and in scheduling the
arbitration proceedings. If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator,
such arbitrator shall be appointed by JAMS. The party requesting arbitration
shall be responsible for completing and sending to the JAMS' office for
Riverside County, California, such forms as JAMS may require to commence such
arbitration proceedings. Each party shall initially advance one-half (1/2) of
JAMS' and the arbitrator's fees, and each party shall bear its own attorneys'
fees if it chooses to be represented by an attorney in the arbitration. The
arbitrator shall award to the prevailing party in the arbitration the fees it
paid to JAMS and the arbitrator, together with reasonable attorneys' fees, which
award will be payable by the other party within thirty (30) days after the
arbitrator mails his or her decision. Judgment upon the award rendered by the
arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. If JAMS is
not available in Riverside County, the parties shall use JAMS in Orange County.
If JAMS is not available in either Riverside or Orange Counties, the parties
shall use the arbitration and mediation services provided by the American
Arbitration Association ("AAA"). If JAMS and AAA are not available or no longer
in existence, then the parties agree to use good faith efforts to select an
alternative arbitration and mediation service, and the procedures set forth
above shall apply to such substitute service.

         12.3     Condemnation Award. Landlord shall be entitled to all damages
or compensation awarded in any eminent domain proceeding relating to its fee
simple interest in the Premises and Improvements paid for by Landlord at
Landlord's expense. Tenant shall be entitled to all damages, compensation and
proceeds awarded in any eminent domain proceeding that comprise Tenant's Eminent
Domain TI Proceeds (as defined below) and/or pertain to Tenant's leasehold
interest, loss of goodwill, relocation expenses, loss of business, business
interruption, loss and/or removal of Tenant's trade fixtures, furniture,
equipment and other personal property. For purposes hereof, "TENANT'S EMINENT
DOMAIN TI PROCEEDS" shall mean all damages, compensation and proceeds awarded in
any eminent domain proceeding for or pertaining to loss

and/or removal of leasehold improvements and alterations at the Premises made by
Tenant or Landlord from (i) the Tenant Improvement Allowance (but not with
respect to any eminent domain proceeding which results in a termination of this
Lease prior to the end of the initial 10-year Term of this Lease), and/or (ii)
Tenant's own funds.

         12.4     Landlord's Duty to Restore. In the event that there is a
taking and this Lease is not terminated pursuant to this Article 12, Landlord
shall, at its own expense (but only to the extent Landlord has received
condemnation proceeds therefor), repair and restore the Improvements and the
other portions of the Premises, including the fixtures, systems and equipment
owned by Landlord and all leasehold improvements and alterations within the
Improvements, to (i) a condition suitable for Tenant's use as close to their
original condition as possible, and (ii) as reasonably necessary to ensure that
the Premises continue to operate in accordance with all Applicable Laws and with
the standards prevailing from time to time for comparable
warehouse/distributions facilities in the vicinity of the Premises.

         12.5     Restoration Requirements. All repair and restoration of the
Premises to be made by Landlord pursuant to Paragraph 12.4 hereof shall be made
in accordance with plans and specifications approved by Tenant. Landlord shall
comply, and shall require all its contractors to comply, with all Applicable
Laws relating to conditions of employment in making such repairs and
restoration. In the event that there is a taking and this Lease is not
terminated pursuant to this Article 12, any and all proceeds owing to Landlord
resulting from any eminent domain proceedings based on such taking shall be
deposited into a mutually acceptable joint Construction Escrow to be established
by Landlord and Tenant in the same manner as provided in Paragraph 9.1.3 above,
and used to pay for the costs of such repairs and restoration. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, if by reason of the provisions of any such mortgage or deed of
trust executed by Landlord on the Premises, any such eminent domain proceeds are
required to be made payable to the lien holder, Tenant hereby consents thereto,
provided that the lien holder in question (i) shall first agree in writing with
Landlord to make said proceeds available for such repair and restoration to the
extent required pursuant to this Article 12, and (ii) shall not have any
interest in the Tenant's Eminent Domain TI Proceeds, and Tenant shall be
entitled to retain any such proceeds.

         12.6     Abatement and Adjustment of Rent. In the event that there is a
taking and this Lease is not terminated pursuant to this Article 12, in addition
to any right Tenant may have to abate Fixed Rent and Real Property Taxes
pursuant to Paragraph 2.2 hereof, a reduction of the annual Fixed Rent and Real
Property Taxes payable under Paragraphs 2.1 and 6.1 hereof shall be made as
follows: (i) if a portion of the Building is taken, the annual Fixed Rent and
Real Property Taxes shall be reduced by the ratio of the total Rentable Area
taken to the total Rentable Area of the Building; and (ii) if a portion of the
parking, landscaping and other areas of the Premises located outside the
Building is taken, an equitable reduction in the Fixed Rent and Real Property
Taxes shall be made, based on the amount taken and proximity of the portion
taken to the Building and the adverse effect on Tenant's business in the
Premises.

         12.7     Definition of Taking. A "TAKING OR APPROPRIATION", as used in
this Article 12, shall be deemed to include one or more takings or
appropriations, and the cumulative effect of more than one such taking or
appropriation shall be construed as one taking or appropriation.

Appropriation or taking by eminent domain as used herein shall also include a
conveyance made as a settlement to an existing or threatened eminent domain
proceeding.

         12.8     Conflict with Article 8. Where the provisions of this Article
12 are in conflict with the Applicable Laws of the State of California, or with
the provisions of Article 8 hereof, the provisions of this Article 12 shall
apply.

ARTICLE 13: ATTORNEYS' FEES.

         In the event either party hereto commences legal proceedings to enforce
any of the terms of this Lease, or for damages resulting from a breach of this
Lease, the successful party in such action shall receive from the other party,
in each such action, including any appeal taken thereof, its reasonable
attorneys' fees and costs incurred. Whenever one party is obligated to indemnify
the other party under the terms of this Lease, said duty to indemnify shall
include the duty to defend the other party and to pay for all reasonable
attorneys' fees, costs and disbursements related to said defense. The term
attorneys' fees as used in this Article 13 shall include the fair market value
of Landlord's and Tenant's in-house counsel's services.

ARTICLE 14: PERMITS AND LICENSES.

         Landlord hereby covenants and agrees to fully and promptly cooperate
with Tenant, at no cost to Landlord, in Tenant's efforts (which shall be at
Tenant's sole cost and expense) to apply for and secure any building permit,
signage variances and/or permission of any duly constituted authority for the
purpose of doing any of the things which Tenant is required or permitted to do
under the provisions of this Lease, and Landlord shall indemnify Tenant for any
loss, cost or damage (excluding lost profits or other consequential damages)
suffered by Tenant as a result of Landlord's failure to so cooperate.

ARTICLE 15: EXTENSION OF TERM.

         15.1     Tenant's Right to Extend Lease Term. Tenant shall have the
right to extend the Term of this Lease upon the same terms, covenants, and
conditions as herein contained, and at the Fixed Rent rate herein reserved in
Paragraph 2.1.3 above, for three (3) additional consecutive periods of five (5)
years each (each an "OPTION PERIOD" and collectively the "OPTION PERIODS") from
and after the Expiration Date hereof, by giving Landlord notice at least six (6)
months prior to the Expiration Date, and prior to each such extended expiration
date (as the case may be), notifying Landlord of Tenant's election to so extend
the Term; provided, however, in the event that Tenant fails to give such notice
of extension, Tenant shall not be deemed to have waived the right to that
extension or any extension thereafter until Landlord gives Tenant written notice
of Tenant's failure to exercise such right of extension and affords Tenant a
period of thirty (30) days after receipt of such notice to exercise that right
of extension by giving Landlord notice thereof. Wherever there is a reference in
this Lease to the Term of this Lease, or to the expiration of this Lease, such
references shall be construed to include any extension of the Term of this
Lease. Notwithstanding the foregoing to the contrary, Tenant shall not have the
right to extend the Term for the applicable Option Period if at the time Tenant
delivers to Landlord Tenant's exercise notice, Tenant is then in monetary or
material non-monetary default under the Lease after expiration of all applicable
notice and cure periods.

         15.2     Interference Period. Whenever Tenant shall be prevented in
whole or in part from the free, uninterrupted, and unimpeded enjoyment of the
use of the Premises and the fixtures therein by reason of default of Landlord,
or by reason of Landlord's making any repairs, alterations, extensions or
additions to the Premises, or the fixtures therein, or by reason of any casualty
event or eminent domain proceedings, and such prevention or disturbance lasts
for a period in excess of ninety (90) days, then, and in each and all of such
cases, Tenant shall have the right of extension, as hereinafter defined, which
right shall be cumulative and additional to any other rights given in such cases
by this Lease or Applicable Laws. Said right of extension shall give Tenant the
option (to be exercised at least ninety (90) days before the conclusion of the
Term) to add any such period or periods of loss of such enjoyment, or the
aggregate of all such periods, to the Term of this Lease.

ARTICLE 16: SUBORDINATION.

         16.1     Permitted Deed of Trust. In the event Landlord acquires fee
simple title to the Land with acquisition and/or construction financing secured
by a Permitted Deed of Trust (as defined in Paragraph 3.1 above), then
concurrently upon the closing of such acquisition, Landlord shall deliver to
Tenant a subordination, nondisturbance and attornment agreement ("SNDA")
executed by Landlord and the holder of such Permitted Deed of Trust in the form
attached hereto as Exhibit E, with any reasonable modifications thereto which do
not increase any of Tenant's obligations or diminish or impair any of Tenant's
rights under this Lease as shall be reasonably required by the holder of such
Permitted Deed of Trust and reasonably approved by Tenant. If Landlord fails to
deliver the executed SNDA to Tenant concurrently upon such closing, Tenant may,
at its option, in addition to its other remedies under this Lease: (i) terminate
this Lease effective upon the date written termination notice is delivered to
Landlord, which termination notice may be delivered at any time prior to the
date such executed SNDA is delivered to Tenant, in which event the provisions of
Paragraph 1.5.5 above shall apply; or (ii) defer the payment of any and all
rental due under this Lease until such executed SNDA is delivered to Tenant.
During such period of deferral, said rental shall accrue without interest.
Tenant shall pay such accrued rent in full to Landlord within forty-five (45)
days after Tenant's receipt of such executed SNDA in recordable form.

         16.2     Future Deeds of Trust. Tenant covenants that it will execute
an agreement subordinating this Lease to any first priority deed of trust
subsequently placed upon the Premises after Landlord's acquisition of fee simple
title to the Land in the form attached hereto as Exhibit E, with any reasonable
modifications thereto which do not increase any of Tenant's obligations or
diminish or impair any of Tenant's rights under this Lease as shall be
reasonably required by the holder of such deed of trust and reasonably approved
by Tenant. Tenant agrees to execute and deliver such agreement to Landlord
within twenty (20) days after such agreement is delivered by Landlord to Tenant
in the form (and with such modifications) as approved by Tenant in accordance
with the foregoing provisions of this Paragraph 16.2.

         16.3     Landlord's Waiver. Landlord hereby waives and releases any
lien or claim of lien, statutory or otherwise, which Landlord may be entitled to
assert under Applicable Laws upon or against any inventory, fixtures, furniture,
equipment and other personal property of Tenant situated at the Premises.
Landlord covenants that concurrently upon Landlord's execution of this Lease
and/or subsequent to the execution of this Lease at Tenant's request,

                                      -39-

Landlord will execute an agreement setting forth certain information regarding
this Lease, as well as acknowledging certain rights of Tenant and any lender of
Tenant, in the form attached hereto as Exhibit F. In addition, Landlord agrees
to execute any other document reasonably requested from time to time by Tenant
and/or any lender, supplier, vendor, lessor or other lienholder in connection
with Tenant's inventory, trade fixtures, furniture, equipment or other personal
property, pursuant to which Landlord expressly waives any lien Landlord might
otherwise have or acquire upon such property.

ARTICLE 17: TENANT'S DEFAULTS.

         17.1     Monetary Defaults. Should Tenant fail to make any payment of
rent required to be paid by Tenant to Landlord hereunder as and when due under
this Lease, and such failure shall continue for five (5) business days after
Tenant's receipt of written notice thereof from Landlord specifying in detail
such failure, then Tenant shall be in default under this Lease and Landlord may,
at its option, in addition to any other remedies provided for such default under
Applicable Laws (but subject to the provisions of Paragraph 10.9.5 above),
terminate and cancel this Lease, and re-enter and take possession of the
Premises, remove Tenant's property therefrom, and dispose of the same in the
manner provided by Applicable Laws. Said five (5) business day notice from
Landlord to Tenant shall be in addition to, and not in lieu of, any statutory
notice for eviction or foreclosure proceedings required under the Applicable
Laws of the State of California (including, without limitation, the provisions
of California Code of Civil Procedure Section 1161 regarding unlawful detainer
actions or any successor statute or law of a similar nature); provided, however,
if Tenant is in default in the payment of rent more than two (2) times in any
12-month period, for the third (3rd) and any subsequent default in such 12-month
period, such five (5) business day notice shall be in lieu of any such statutory
notice for eviction or foreclosure proceedings. Upon such termination, Landlord
may recover from Tenant:

                  (i)      the worth at the time of award of the unpaid rent
which had been earned at the time of termination;

                  (ii)     the worth at the time of award of the amount by which
the unpaid rent which would have been earned after termination until the time of
award exceeds the amount of such rental loss that Tenant proves could have been
reasonably avoided;

                  (iii)    the worth at the time of award of the amount by which
the unpaid rent for the balance of the term after the time of award exceeds the
amount of such rental loss that Tenant proves could be reasonably avoided; and

                  (iv)     any other amount necessary to compensate Landlord for
all the expenses and all the detriment proximately caused by Tenant's failure to
perform its obligations under this Lease or which in the ordinary course of
things would be likely to result therefrom.

The "worth at the time of award" of the amounts referred to in items (i) and
(ii) above is computed by allowing interest at the Interest Rate (defined in
Paragraph 6.4 above). The "worth at the time of award" of the amount referred to
in item (iii) above is computed by discounting such amount at the discount rate
of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco at the time of award plus one
percent (1%). Except as otherwise herein provided, no entry into the Premises or

                                      -40-

any other action by Landlord shall be construed as an election to terminate this
Lease unless written notice of such intention is given to Tenant, or unless
termination thereof is decreed by a court of competent jurisdiction.

                  17.1.1 In the event this Lease is terminated as provided in
this Paragraph 17.1, Tenant shall promptly remove all personal property to which
it has the right to possession. All property of Tenant not removed by Tenant
within ten (10) business days after Tenant's receipt of notice of a final
adjudication that the Lease has been terminated shall be disposed of by Landlord
in the manner provided by Applicable Laws.

                  17.1.2 Landlord shall also have the remedy described in
California Civil Code Section 1951.4 (which provides that lessor may continue
lease in effect after lessee's breach and abandonment and recover rent as it
becomes due, if lessee has the right to sublet or assign, subject only to
reasonable limitations). Accordingly, if Landlord does not elect to terminate
this Lease on account of any default by Tenant, Landlord may, from time to time,
without terminating this Lease, enforce all of its rights and remedies under
this Lease, including the right to recover all rent as it becomes due (in
accordance with California Civil Code Section 1951.4).

         17.2     Non-Monetary Defaults. If Tenant shall be in default in the
performance of any obligation under this Lease other than in the payment of
rent, and if Tenant shall fail to cure such default within thirty (30) days of
receipt of notice from Landlord, specifying in detail the nature of such
default, or in case the default is of such a character as to reasonably require
more than thirty (30) days to cure, then if Tenant shall fail to use reasonable
diligence in curing or attempting to cure such default, then Landlord may cure
such default for the account of and at the cost and expense of Tenant. The sum
so expended by Landlord shall be deemed to be additional rent if Tenant fails to
pay to Landlord the sum so expended within thirty (30) days after Tenant's
receipt of notice of a final adjudication that such amount is owing to Landlord,
including interest at the Interest Rate from the date of expenditure by Landlord
until paid.

                  17.2.1 In addition to the foregoing, if Tenant shall be in
material default in the performance of any non-monetary obligation under this
Lease which cannot be cured by Landlord by the payment of money or the exercise
of Landlord's self-help rights as set forth in Paragraph 17.2 above, and if
Tenant shall fail to cure such default within the time periods set forth in
Paragraph 17.2 above, Landlord shall be entitled to exercise all rights and
remedies set forth in Paragraph 17.1 above. In no event shall any such default,
other than the failure to pay rent, be the basis of a forfeiture of this Lease
or otherwise result in the eviction of Tenant or the termination of this Lease,
unless and except to the extent specifically and expressly permitted under this
Paragraph 17.2.

                  17.2.2 In addition to Landlord's right to cure such
non-monetary default and recover the amount so expended in curing such
non-monetary default, Landlord shall have the right to injunctive relief and/or
recover damages (subject, however, to the limitations in Paragraph 10.9.5 above)
for Tenant's default of any such obligation, covenant or agreement.

         17.3     Bankruptcy. In the event of the commencement of voluntary or
involuntary proceedings by or against Tenant under the United States Bankruptcy
Code, which proceedings are not dismissed within ninety (90) days after the same
are filed, then subject to and limited by

                                      -41-

the provisions of the United States Bankruptcy Code, as amended, including any
subsequent amendments thereto, Tenant shall be deemed to be in default under
this Lease and Landlord shall be entitled to exercise all rights and remedies
set forth in Paragraph 17.1 above.

         17.4     Landlord's Remedies Cumulative. Any right or remedy Landlord
may have under this Paragraph 17 arising out of Tenant's uncured default under
this Lease shall be in addition to any other right or remedy for such uncured
default provided for by Applicable Law and/or in equity (subject, however, to
the limitations in Paragraphs 10.9.5 and 17.2.1 above), including, without
limitation, the right to recover damages as a result thereof.

ARTICLE 18: LANDLORD'S DEFAULTS.

         18.1     Tenant's Right to Cure. If Landlord (i) fails to pay any
installment of taxes or assessments or any interest, principal, costs or other
charges upon any lien or encumbrance affecting the Premises when any of the same
becomes due and such failure to pay could or would result in (A) a termination
of this Lease, (B) loss of quiet enjoyment of the Premises, (C) impairment or
loss of any of Tenant's rights under this Lease, or (D) increase in any of
Tenant's obligations under this Lease, or (ii) fails to pay any other monetary
amounts required to be paid by Landlord under this Lease (including, without
limitation, payments of any costs and/or the Tenant Improvement Allowance
pursuant to Exhibit C) when any of the same becomes due, or (iii) fails to
perform Landlord's Maintenance Obligations or make any other repairs or do any
other work required of Landlord by the provisions of this Lease, or (iv) in any
other respect fails to perform any other obligation under this Lease to be
performed by Landlord (including, without limitation, any obligation under
Exhibit C), then Landlord shall be in default under this Lease, and Tenant may
(but this shall not be deemed to impose an obligation upon Tenant to do so), in
addition to any other rights provided under this Lease, at law and/or in equity
(but subject to the provisions of Paragraph 10.9.5 above) as a result of any
such default:

                  (1)      recover from Landlord any and all damages resulting
         therefrom; and/or

                  (2)      at the expense of Landlord, pay such charges and/or
         cure such defaults on behalf of Landlord and/or do all necessary work
         and make all necessary payments in connection therewith.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, no right or remedy of Tenant shall be exercised
unless Landlord fails to cure such default within fifteen (15) business days
(with respect to monetary defaults) and thirty (30) days (with respect to
non-monetary defaults) after receipt of notice from Tenant specifying in detail
the nature of such default; provided, however, that with respect to non-monetary
defaults only, if such non-monetary default is of such nature as cannot be cured
within said 30-day period, Landlord shall not be deemed in default hereunder if,
and so long as, Landlord commences to cure such default within said 30-day
period and proceeds diligently and continuously to complete the cure of such
default within such reasonable additional time as is necessary to cure such
default; provided, further, however, that if a failure by Landlord to perform or
observe any term of this Lease gives rise to circumstances or conditions which
constitute an emergency threatening human health or safety or substantial damage
to the Premises or Tenant's personal property, or materially impeding the
conduct of the business of Tenant at the Premises, Tenant shall be entitled to
take immediate curative action (prior to the

                                      -42-

expiration of any notice and cure period set forth above) to the extent
reasonably necessary to eliminate the emergency. Landlord shall pay to Tenant,
within ten (10) business days after demand, the amount so paid by Tenant in the
exercise of any such rights and remedies, together with interest thereon from
the date of such expenditure at the Interest Rate. However, if Landlord desires
to contest the validity or correctness of any lien or encumbrance described in
clause (i) hereinabove, it may do so, provided that if such lien or encumbrance
could or would result in any of the events described in clauses (A) through (D)
set forth in clause (i) hereinabove, Landlord shall first furnish Tenant with a
good and sufficient bond indemnifying Tenant against any loss, liability or
damage (excluding lost profits and consequential damages) on account thereof.

         18.2     Tenant's Right to Offset. If Landlord shall fail to pay to
Tenant the amount of such expenditures and interest within fifteen (15) business
days of written demand from Tenant to do so, in addition to any other rights
provided under this Lease, at law and/or in equity, Tenant may deduct the amount
of such expenditures and interest from any and all rental payments and other
payments thereafter becoming due to Landlord hereunder. In no event shall such
deduction by Tenant pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Paragraph 18.2
be the basis of forfeiture of this Lease or constitute a default by Tenant in
the payment of rent unless Tenant shall fail to pay the amount of such deduction
within thirty (30) days after Tenant's receipt of notice of a final adjudication
that such amount is owing to Landlord. Nothing herein contained shall preclude
Tenant from proceeding to collect any amount paid by it pursuant to Paragraph
18.1 without waiting for rental offsets to accrue.

         18.3     Tenant's Rights Cumulative. Any right or remedy Tenant may
have under this Lease arising out of Landlord's breach of any representation,
warranty or covenant of this Lease shall be in addition to any other right or
remedy for such breach provided for by Applicable Law and/or in equity (subject,
however, to the limitations in Paragraph 10.9.5 above), including, without
limitation, the right to recover damages as a result thereof. The terms,
conditions and provisions of this Article 18 are in all respects subject and
subordinate to Landlord's covenant of quiet enjoyment to Tenant set forth in
Article 3 of this Lease, and the parties agree that the rights and remedies set
forth in this Article 18 are not intended to nullify, impair or negate in any
manner or to any extent the covenant of quiet enjoyment, and Landlord
acknowledges and agrees that in the event of conflict between Article 18 or any
other provision of this Lease, the covenant of quiet enjoyment shall control.

ARTICLE 19: NOTICES.

         19.1     Manner of Delivery. Any notices, demands, and the like, which
are required to be given hereunder or which either party hereto may desire to
give to the other shall be given in writing by (i) mailing the same by certified
or registered United States mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, or
(ii) sending the same by Federal Express or other comparable overnight express
courier service (with proof of receipt available), addressed to Landlord at the
address for notices shown in Paragraph 20.15 hereof, or to Tenant, at 2525 East
El Segundo Boulevard, El Segundo, California 90245, attention of the President
or Secretary of Tenant, or to such other addresses as the respective parties may
from time to time designate by notice given as provided in this Lease. Notices
shall be deemed effective upon receipt or refusal to accept receipt (as
evidenced by supporting documentation).

         19.2     Statutory Service. Any notice served on Tenant pursuant to any
statutory procedure related to forfeiture or eviction proceedings under the
Applicable Laws of the State of California shall be served on Tenant's
authorized agent for service of process under such Applicable Laws, or the
President or Secretary of Tenant at the address specified in Paragraph 19.1
hereof. Wherever there is a conflict between the provisions of this Paragraph
19.2 and any such statutory procedure, the provisions of this Paragraph 19.2
shall prevail.

         19.3     Landlord Entity. If Landlord is a partnership, corporation or
limited liability company, Tenant may act on any notice given by any officer or
agent (which has been designated in writing by Landlord) of such corporation, or
of any general partner or agent (which has been designated in writing by
Landlord) of such partnership, or of any managing member or agent (which has
been designated in writing by Landlord) of such limited liability company.

ARTICLE 20: MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS.

         20.1     Effect of Words; Gender; Singular; Plural. Whenever in this
Lease any words of obligation or duty regarding either of the parties are used,
such words shall have the same force and effect as though in the express form of
covenants. Whenever appropriate from the context, the use of any gender shall
include any other or all genders, and the singular number shall include the
plural, and the plural shall include the singular.

         20.2     Memorandum of Lease; Recording Fees. Concurrently with the
execution of this Lease, the parties shall execute and acknowledge three (3)
originals of a memorandum of lease in the form of Exhibit G attached hereto and
incorporated herein by this reference (the "MEMORANDUM OF LEASE"). Each party
shall retain one (1) executed original of the Memorandum of Lease and deliver
the third (3rd) executed original to the escrow holder of the escrow for
Landlord's acquisition of the Larger Parcel (including the Land). Landlord shall
cause such escrow holder to record the Memorandum of Lease (or as described in
Recital B above, such modified version in substitution thereof to be executed by
the parties and delivered to such escrow holder if the Subdivision occurs
concurrently with the Land Acquisition, rather than after the Land Acquisition
as currently contemplated by the parties) in the Official Records upon the
closing date of Landlord's acquisition of fee simple title to the Larger Parcel
(including the Land), as described in Paragraph 3.3(i) above. If required by the
county recorder's office, or such escrow holder or title company in connection
with the recordation of the Memorandum of Lease, Landlord and Tenant shall
update the date of, execute and acknowledge the Memorandum of Lease prior to
recording same. If the Subdivision occurs after the Land Acquisition, the
parties shall execute and acknowledge the Memorandum of Lease Amendment and
cause the same to be recorded in the Official Records immediately after
recordation of the final parcel map subdividing the Land from the Larger Parcel.
Prior to attaching any legal description of the Land to the Memorandum of Lease
or Memorandum of Lease Amendment, Tenant shall approve same for accuracy. This
Lease, the Memorandum of Lease (or modified version thereof, as the case may be)
and the Memorandum of Lease Amendment (if applicable) shall be construed
together as one instrument. Neither party shall record this Lease or permit the
same to be recorded without the written consent of the other party. Tenant
agrees to pay all recording fees due for bringing about the recording of the
Memorandum of Lease and Memorandum of Lease Amendment (if applicable).

         20.3     No Waiver of Subsequent Breaches. No waiver of any breach of
any of the covenants, agreements or provisions contained herein shall be
construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach of the same or any other
covenant, agreement or provision. No payment of rent or other charges payable
hereunder by Tenant shall be construed as a waiver by Tenant of any breach by
Landlord under this Lease.

         20.4     Successors and Assigns. This Lease binds, applies to and
inures to the benefit of, as the case may require, the heirs, executors,
administrators, successors and assigns of Landlord and the successors and
assigns of Tenant.

         20.5     Conflicting Claims to Money Payable by Tenant. Tenant may make
any payment or give any notice to Landlord, despite any succession or
assignments, and be protected in so doing, until it has received written notice
to do otherwise from Landlord, or, in case of Landlord's death if Landlord is a
natural person, from the executor or administrator, together with a certified
copy of letters testamentary or letters of administration. If there are
conflicting claims to money payable by Tenant under this Lease, Tenant may
discharge its obligation to pay such amounts by depositing such money in trust
with the holder of any first mortgage or first deed of trust on the Premises of
whom Tenant has received written notice and in all other events in any bank or
trust company designated from time to time in writing by Landlord (provided such
designation is given prior to receipt by Tenant of conflicting claims), and if
no such designation is given, then in any bank or trust company in the county in
which the Premises are located, to be distributed pursuant to court order;
provided, however, Tenant need not recognize any such adverse claims, and may
pay the money directly to Landlord. All sums payable hereunder by either party
to the other are payable in lawful money of the United States of America.

         20.6     Table of Contents; Headings. The table of contents and the
captions heading the various articles of this Lease are for convenience and
identification only, and shall not be deemed to expand, limit or define the
contents of their respective paragraphs.

         20.7     Brokers' Commissions. Each party hereby represents and
warrants to the other that it has not caused or incurred any claims for
brokerage commissions or finder's fees in connection with the execution and
delivery of this Lease, the Memorandum of Lease and the Memorandum of Lease
Amendment (if applicable), other than to Charles Ogburn of Ogburn & Associates
(representing Tenant) and CB Richard Ellis, Inc. (representing Landlord)
(collectively, the "BROKERS"), the payment of which shall be the sole
responsibility of Landlord, which payment shall be made in accordance with the
terms of a separate listing agreement made by and among Landlord and the
Brokers. Each party shall indemnify and hold harmless the other from and against
any other claims for commissions or finder's fees caused by the party whose
actions or alleged commitments form the basis of such claim.

         20.8     Approvals. Whenever the approval of Landlord or Tenant is
required hereunder, such approval shall be in writing and be given pursuant to
Article 19 hereof. Such approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed (unless another standard for approval is specifically provided for in
this Lease with respect to a particular matter, which specific approval standard
shall control).

the Memorandum of Lease Amendment (if applicable), taken together, comprise the
entire agreement between the parties hereto. There shall be no amendments to
this Lease except by written agreement between the parties.

         20.10    Severability of Provisions; Governing Law. In the event that
any provision of this Lease shall be held invalid or unenforceable, such
provision shall be severable from, and such invalidity or unenforceability shall
not be construed to have any effect on, the remaining provisions of this Lease.
This Lease shall be construed and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the
State of California.

         20.11    Lease Freely Negotiated. This Lease was freely and voluntarily

Plans, Landlord shall, at Tenant's expense (but subject to Landlord's
contribution of the Tenant Improvement Allowance), cause all plans,
specifications and working drawings for the Tenant Improvements to be prepared
in accordance with, based upon and incorporating the minimum specifications set
forth in the TI Layout Plans (collectively, the "TI CONSTRUCTION DRAWINGS"). The
Building/Site Work Construction Drawings and the TI Construction Drawings
(collectively, the "CONSTRUCTION DRAWINGS") shall be prepared by Carlisle
Coatsworth Architects (or by another architect selected by Landlord and approved
by Tenant), and by engineers and other consultants selected by Landlord and
approved by Tenant. The Building/Site Work Construction Drawings shall
incorporate the Minimum Building/Site Work Specifications as set forth above.
The Construction Drawings shall be in such form and detail as (i) required for
submission to the applicable governmental authorities for the issuance of all
applicable building permits and governmental approvals, and (ii) shall be
adequate for construction of Landlord's Work by Landlord's Contractor and
bidding by all subcontractors. The Construction Drawings shall be submitted by
Landlord to Tenant for Tenant's approval, by no later than July 1, 2004, and
shall be approved by both Tenant and Landlord pursuant to the procedures set
forth below in this Paragraph 2 prior to (A) commencement of construction of

the appropriate governmental authorities (including but not limited to Building
and Health Departments) for approval and issuance of permits. All plans and
specifications delivered to Tenant pursuant to this Paragraph 2 shall consist of
two (2) sets of plans and specifications plus one (1) reproducible set of plans
and specifications.

         2.3      Tenant's Approval of Construction Drawings. Landlord shall
cooperate and coordinate with Tenant and Tenant's consultants in Landlord's
preparation of the Construction Drawings. Landlord shall keep Tenant and
Tenant's consultants informed of the progress thereof to enable consideration of
Tenant's needs and suggestions therefor, as well as to enable coordination with
the planning for the design and installation of the Tenant Fixturization Work to
be performed by Tenant as provided in this Exhibit C. Tenant shall review and
approve (or reasonably disapprove) all phases of the Construction Drawings
(including, but not limited to, elevations, grading plans, schematic plans, and
architectural and engineering drawings and specifications); provided, however,
that notwithstanding Tenant's review and approval of any such phases of the
Construction Drawings, Tenant shall not have any responsibility or liability for
any such Construction Drawings, any design errors or defects therein and/or
compliance of same with Applicable Laws and the other requirements in this
Exhibit C. Tenant shall approve or reasonably disapprove the Construction
Drawings as submitted by Landlord to Tenant within ten (10) business days after
Tenant's receipt thereof. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, Tenant shall not be required to approve (i) any portion of the
Building/Site Work Construction Drawings that do not incorporate, or are
otherwise inconsistent with, the Minimum Building/Site Work Specifications, or
(ii) any portion of the TI Construction Drawings that are inconsistent with,
and/or do not incorporate the minimum specifications set forth in, the TI Layout
Plans. Any notice of disapproval of any portions of the Construction Drawings
from Tenant shall state the reasons for disapproval and the specific changes
which Tenant requests be made. Landlord, upon receipt of any such notice of
disapproval from Tenant, shall revise such portion(s) of the Construction
Drawings as have been disapproved in a manner so as to incorporate Tenant's
proposed specific changes, and resubmit such revised Construction Drawings to
Tenant as soon as reasonably possible thereafter, but in any event within ten
(10) business days after receipt of such notice of disapproval. Tenant shall
have five (5) business days after receipt of such revised Construction Drawings
to notify Landlord of Tenant's approval

                                    EXHIBIT C
                                       -3-

or reasonable disapproval of such revised Construction Drawings (with any
changes required by Tenant for Tenant's approval to be specified in such
notice), and Landlord shall, upon receipt of such notice of disapproval from
Tenant, revise such portion(s) of the Construction Drawings as have been
disapproved in a manner so as to incorporate Tenant's proposed revisions, and
resubmit such revised Construction Drawings to Tenant as soon as reasonably
possible thereafter, but in any event within five (5) business days after
Landlord's receipt of such notice of disapproval. The foregoing process shall
continue until all phases of the Construction Drawings have been approved by
Tenant.

         2.4      Final Plans. The Building/Site Work Construction Drawings for
the Building/Site Work, as so finally approved by Tenant pursuant to the
foregoing provisions of this Paragraph 2, shall be referred to herein,
collectively, as the "FINAL BUILDING/SITE WORK PLANS". The TI Construction
Drawings for the Tenant Improvements, as so finally approved by Tenant pursuant
to the foregoing provisions of this Paragraph 2, shall be referred to herein,
collectively, as the "FINAL TI PLANS".

3.       No Changes by Landlord to Final Plans. Once the Final Building/Site
Work Plans and Final TI Plans (collectively, the "FINAL PLANS") have been so
approved by Tenant, Landlord may make no changes thereto without Tenant's prior
approval, which may be withheld or granted in Tenant's sole and absolute
discretion; provided, however, to the extent such changes (i) are required by
any applicable governmental authority as a condition to the issuance of the
applicable governmental permits and approvals for Landlord's Work, (ii) pertain
to substitution of any materials that are specified in the Final Plans but are
not readily available to meet the schedule of construction of Landlord's Work
contemplated in this Exhibit C, and/or (iii) are minor changes which shall not
adversely affect Tenant's use of or operation of its business in the Premises
for the Permitted Use, Tenant shall not unreasonably withhold its consent
thereto so long as (A) such changes do not create a Tenant Design Problem (as
defined below), and (B) any substituted materials are of at least equivalent
quantity and quality as the original materials specified on the Final Plans. For
purposes hereof, a "TENANT DESIGN PROBLEM" shall mean changes that are (1)
inconsistent with the Minimum Building/ Site Work Specifications or the TI
Layout Plans, or (2) materially inconsistent with any portion of the Final Plans
initially approved by Tenant.

4.       Tenant Change Orders.

         4.1      Request for Tenant Change Orders. At any time following
Tenant's and Landlord's approval of any portion of the Final Plans, Tenant may
direct, by a written change order request ("TENANT CHANGE ORDER"), any change in
Landlord's Work depicted on the Final Plans, including, without limitation, in
order to reduce (by "value engineering" or otherwise) the cost of any Tenant
Improvements depicted on the Final Plans. No Tenant Change Order shall, however:
(i) materially adversely affect the exterior appearance (other than Tenant's
Signs) of the Land or the Building; or (ii) cause a violation of any Applicable
Laws pertaining to the construction and occupancy of the Improvements. Subject
to the provisions of Paragraph 4.2 below, and the immediately preceding
sentence, Landlord shall diligently implement any Tenant Change Order requested
by Tenant. Any Tenant Change Order shall outline in reasonably specific detail
the change requested and shall further specify the reasons for such proposed

                                    EXHIBIT C

change. Tenant's request for any Tenant Change Order, and the implementation
thereof, may constitute a Tenant Delay as and to the extent provided in
Paragraph 6 below.

         4.2      Pricing Requests. Tenant may, at its option and before the
issuance of a Tenant Change Order pursuant to the provisions of this Paragraph
4, submit to Landlord a "PRICING REQUEST", which shall outline with reasonably
specific detail the changes Tenant desires to have priced. Upon receipt of a
Pricing Request, Landlord shall, as soon thereafter as reasonably possible, but
in no event later than seven (7) business days thereafter, deliver a statement
to Tenant which sets forth: (i) the estimated cost of such change, together with
a reasonably detailed breakdown thereof ("PRICING STATEMENT") and reasonable
information concerning the availability of materials and labor required in
connection with the proposed change; (ii) the effect that such change would have
on the time of construction (either as an increase or a decrease) and the costs
of the delays resulting therefrom; and (iii) Landlord's determination whether
the proposed change would violate the provisions of clauses (i) and/or (ii) of
Paragraph 4.1 above. In the event Tenant approves the applicable Tenant Change
Order as provided in Paragraph 4.3 below, Tenant shall be responsible for the
cost of the Tenant Change Order as and to the extent provided in Paragraph 5.4.2
below.

         4.3      Review of Pricing Statements. Upon receipt of any Pricing
Statement, Tenant shall have five (5) business days to review such Pricing
Statement. Upon completion of such review, Tenant shall have the option to
either: (i) accept the Pricing Statement and request a Tenant Change Order
conforming to the Pricing Statement, as applicable, in which event Tenant shall
be deemed to have agreed, for all purposes of this Exhibit C, to the estimates
and determinations of Landlord pursuant to clauses (ii) and (iii) of Paragraph
4.2 above; or (ii) reject the Pricing Statement. Should Tenant timely accept the
Pricing Statement, Landlord shall promptly thereafter prepare a Tenant Change
Order in accordance with the provisions of Paragraph 4.1 above. In no event,
however, shall Landlord be required to perform any Tenant Change Order which
would be technically impossible to perform or which would be unlawful. If within
such five (5) business day period Tenant rejects a Pricing Statement, or fails
to respond to such Pricing Statement, then Tenant shall be deemed to have
elected not to proceed with the proposed Tenant Change Order which is the
subject of such Pricing Statement, and Landlord shall perform Landlord's Work in
accordance with the Final Plans therefor without the implementation of such
proposed Tenant Change Order.

5.       Permits; Construction of Landlord's Work.

         5.1      Permits. Promptly following Tenant's approval of the Final
Building/Site Work Plans, Landlord shall, at Landlord's cost (and promptly
following Tenant's approval of the Final TI Plans, Landlord shall, at Tenant's
expense, subject to contribution of the Tenant Improvement Allowance), commence
and diligently proceed to obtain, and shall be solely responsible for obtaining,
all applicable permits and other governmental approvals for the construction of
the Building/Site Work and Tenant Improvements, respectively (collectively, the
"PERMITS"). All fees and other charges required to be paid to any governmental
authority in connection with Landlord's Work shall be timely paid by Landlord
(subject, however, to the provisions of Paragraph 5.4.2 below). In the event
that it is not possible to obtain the necessary Permits for Landlord's Work
without incorporating changes to the Final Plans which would both cause a Tenant
Design Problem and materially adverse affect Tenant's use of or operation of its
business

in the Premises for the Permitted Use (hereinafter, a "TERMINABLE EVENT"), then,
notwithstanding Landlord's and Tenant's reasonable efforts to resolve the
requested change in a manner that would not result in a Terminable Event, Tenant
shall have the right, upon written notice to Landlord, to terminate the Lease
unless, within ten (10) business days after such termination notice is delivered
to Landlord, such Permits are obtained in a manner that would not result in a
Terminable Event or is otherwise reasonably acceptable to Tenant. All costs
incurred in connection with modifying the Final Plans to meet the requirements
of all applicable governmental agencies, and all additional improvements
required in connection therewith, shall be paid by Landlord (subject, however,
to the provisions of Paragraph 5.4.2 below).

         5.2      Construction of Landlord's Work; Guaranteed Maximum
Construction Contract for Tenant Improvements. Following Tenant's approval of
the Final Building/Site Work Plans and Landlord's receipt of all applicable
Permits for the Building/Site Work, Landlord shall diligently commence and
complete the construction of the Building/Site Work in a good and workmanlike
manner and in strict compliance with the Final Building/Site Work Plans, all
Applicable Laws and such Permits. Following Tenant's approval of the Final TI
Plans and Landlord's receipt of all applicable Permits for the Tenant
Improvements, Landlord shall diligently commence and complete the construction
of the Tenant Improvements in a good and workmanlike manner and in strict
compliance with the Final TI Plans, all Applicable Laws and such Permits.
Landlord shall cause Landlord's Work (i.e., the Building/Site Work and Tenant
Improvements) to be constructed through a single licensed general contractor
(the "LANDLORD'S CONTRACTOR") and licensed subcontractors, laborers, vendors and
materialmen selected and retained by Landlord, and reasonably approved by Tenant
pursuant to a competitive bidding procedure mutually acceptable to Landlord and
Tenant. Notwithstanding the foregoing to the contrary, Tenant hereby approves
Landlord's selection of Panattoni Construction Inc., a California corporation
("PANATTONI CONSTRUCTION") as Landlord's Contractor, without any competitive
bidding of general contractors, so long as with respect to the Tenant
Improvements component of Landlord's Work only (and not the Building/Site Work):
(i) Panattoni Construction's total compensation for overhead, general conditions
and profit pertaining to the Tenant Improvements constructed hereunder does not
exceed four percent (4%) of the total "hard" costs of constructing the Tenant
Improvements (exclusive of such overhead, general conditions and profit); (ii)
Panattoni Construction competitively bids all work of the Tenant Improvements to
be performed by subcontractors, laborers and materialmen in accordance with a
competitive bidding procedure mutually acceptable to Landlord and Tenant, and
pursuant to which the lowest qualified bidders shall be selected to perform such
work (however, Landlord and Panattoni Construction shall not be required to
competitively bid the Building Site/Work); and (iii) Landlord and Panattoni
Construction enter into a guaranteed maximum construction contract for the
construction of the Tenant Improvements (the "TI CONTRACT"), which TI Contract
shall be reasonably approved by Tenant and based upon and incorporate such
competitive bids and the four percent (4%) maximum overhead, general conditions
and profit payable to Panattoni Construction as provided hereinabove, with all
costs of construction of the Tenant Improvements in excess of the guaranteed
maximum construction contract amount set forth in the approved TI Contract (the
"GMAX TI AMOUNT") to be borne and paid for solely and exclusively by Landlord
from Landlord's own funds (and not deducted from the Tenant Improvement
Allowance), except: (A) with respect to the cost of any Tenant Change Orders to
the extent Tenant is responsible for the payment therefor pursuant to Paragraph
5.4.2 below; and (B) Landlord shall be entitled to receive a supervision fee in
connection with the design and

to the policy required pursuant to clause (iii) hereinabove.

                  5.3.2    Payment of all Liens and Costs. Landlord shall,

Premises free of all liens relating to Landlord's Work and shall diligently file
all appropriate notices of completion for such purpose.

                  5.3.3    Guaranty. Concurrently with the execution of this
Lease, Landlord shall provide to Tenant a Payment and Performance Guaranty (the

diligent payment and performance by Landlord of Landlord's Work, and the prompt
and diligent payment, performance and observance by Landlord of all of
Landlord's other covenants and obligations set forth in this Exhibit C. Such

of the foregoing: (i) Landlord shall provide Tenant with copies of all plans and
specifications and construction schedules reasonably requested by Tenant from
time to time to permit all appropriate review and coordination of Landlord's
Work, and shall provide reasonably detailed reports with respect to the status
of the design, permitting and construction of Landlord's Work on a monthly basis
(or such other periods of time as is reasonably requested by Tenant); (ii) upon
Tenant's request, Landlord shall provide Tenant with copies of all studies,
reports and/or inspections relating to Landlord's Work and/or the Premises; and
(iii) Landlord shall permit Tenant and Tenant's employees, consultants,
contractors and other representatives to enter onto the Premises and into the
Building at reasonable times during the course of the design and construction of
Landlord's Work, to monitor the status and progress of the design and

convene additional meetings as may be reasonably necessary, and Tenant's

provided materials or products or performed services in connection therewith)
after Tenant has delivered to Landlord invoices for such costs.

         6.3      Over-Allowance Amount. Prior to the commencement of the
construction of the Tenant Improvements, and after Landlord has accepted all
subcontractor bids for the Tenant Improvements and entered into the TI Contract

Improvement Allowance (except for up to a ten percent (10%) retention of the
Tenant Improvement Allowance which may be held by Landlord to protect against
mechanics' liens) and the entire portions of the Over-Allowance Amount
previously paid by Tenant have been fully disbursed by Landlord to pay for the
TI Costs; and

                  (iv) Tenant shall pay to Landlord the remaining ten percent

without charge to Tenant or its designers, consultants, architects, engineers,
contractors and subcontractors, and without deduction from the Tenant
Improvement Allowance. In addition, Landlord shall not be entitled to receive,
and there shall be no deduction from the Tenant Improvement Allowance for, any
supervision or coordination fee, profit, overhead or general conditions or
payment of or reimbursement for any other costs incurred by Landlord (including,
without limitation, costs or fees of Landlord's architects, engineers and other
consultants) in connection with the design and installation of the Fixturization
Work.

7.       Tenant Delays.

         7.1      Definition of Tenant Delays. As used herein, "TENANT DELAYS"
are defined as delays (not caused by a Landlord Delay or Force Majeure Delay),
to the extent such delays necessarily and actually delay Landlord's delivery of
possession of the Premises to Tenant in the Delivery Condition as set forth in
Paragraph 1.1 of the Lease, due to any of the following:

                  (i)      Tenant's failure to comply with the time deadlines
imposed upon Tenant as set forth in this Exhibit C;

                  (ii)     Tenant's failure to timely approve or disapprove any
matter expressly requiring Tenant's approval or disapproval pursuant to this
Exhibit C;

                  (iii)    Tenant's breach of any provision of the Lease or this
Exhibit C;

                  (iv)     any Tenant Change Orders requested by Tenant pursuant
to Paragraph 3 above; or

                  (v)      any other wrongful acts or omissions, negligence or
willful misconduct of Tenant or any of Tenant's agents, employees or
contractors.

         7.2      Delivery Condition Delay. In the event the Delivery Date and
Landlord's delivery of possession of the Premises to Tenant in the Delivery
Condition are actually delayed as a result of any Tenant Delays, the Delivery
Date shall be deemed to occur on the date it would have occurred "but for" such
Tenant Delays.

         7.3      Limitations. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this
Paragraph 7 to the contrary:

                                    EXHIBIT C

                  (i)      if a Tenant Delay occurs, but Landlord fails to
provide written notice thereof to Tenant within five (5) business days after
Landlord actually becomes aware of same (which notice shall specify in
reasonable detail the actions, inactions or other circumstances Landlord claims
constitutes such Tenant Delay), then no such Tenant Delay shall be deemed to
have occurred until and from and after the date Landlord delivers such notice to
Tenant;

                  (ii)     no Tenant Delay shall be deemed to have occurred if
Tenant cures the action, inaction or circumstance which Landlord claims
constitutes such Tenant Delay within two (2) business days after such notice is
received by Tenant (however, Tenant shall only be entitled to an aggregate of
fifteen (15) business days in which to cure any such actions, inactions or
circumstances, and any such Tenant Delays occurring after such fifteen (15)
business days of aggregate cure days utilized by Tenant shall be deemed to have
occurred without taking into account any subsequent cure periods hereinabove);
and

                  (iii)    Tenant Delays shall be recognized under this
Paragraph 7 and the Lease only in the event that satisfaction of the Delivery
Condition is delayed, despite Landlord's commercially reasonable efforts to
adapt and compensate for such delays after Landlord becomes aware of same, which
efforts Landlord shall be obligated to make after Landlord becomes aware of
same.

                        PAYMENT AND PERFORMANCE GUARANTY

         This PAYMENT AND PERFORMANCE GUARANTY ("GUARANTY"), dated as of April
14, 2004, is executed by PANATTONI INVESTMENTS, LLC, a California limited
liability company ("GUARANTOR") in favor of BIG 5 CORP., a Delaware corporation
("TENANT"), in conjunction with, and to induce Tenant to enter into, that
certain Lease of even date herewith (the "LEASE") between Tenant and PANATTONI
DEVELOPMENT COMPANY, LLC, a California limited liability company ("LANDLORD"),
pursuant to which Landlord is leasing to Tenant certain "Premises" more
particularly described in the Lease. Capitalized terms used and not otherwise
defined in this Guaranty shall have the meanings set forth for them in the
Lease.

         In consideration of the foregoing, and for other valuable
consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged,
Guarantor hereby agrees as follows:

         1.       Guaranty of Landlord's Obligations. Guarantor hereby
unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees to Tenant the following
(collectively, the "GUARANTEED LANDLORD OBLIGATIONS"):

                  (i)      the prompt and diligent payment and performance of
Landlord's Work, and the prompt and diligent payment, performance and observance
by Landlord of all of Landlord's other covenants and obligations set forth in
Exhibit C attached to the Lease and in the other provisions of the Lease
pertaining and/or relating to Exhibit C and Landlord's delivery of possession of
the Premises to Tenant in the condition required therefor as set forth in the
Lease and Exhibit C (including, without limitation, Landlord's obligations and
covenants under Paragraphs 1.4 and 1.5 of the Lease and the first paragraph of
Paragraph 3.1 of the Lease); provided, however, except for (A) the payment of
the costs of Landlord's Work, and (B) the payment and performance of the
correction of any defects in Landlord's Work which are disclosed by Tenant in
writing to Guarantor prior to the Outside Date (as defined below). Guarantor's
obligations under this clause (i) with respect to the performance of Landlord's
Work shall not extend beyond the Outside Date. As used herein, the "OUTSIDE
DATE" shall mean the date which is one (1) year after Landlord's Work has been
completed as evidenced by a Notice of Completion recorded in the Official
Records;

                  (ii)     the prompt payment by Landlord to Tenant of any
Tenant Termination Amount pursuant to Paragraph 1.5.5 of the Lease, if
applicable; and

                  (iii)    the prompt payment and performance of the correction
of any defects which are Landlord's responsibility to perform pursuant to
Paragraph 7.3 of the Lease and which are disclosed in writing by Tenant to
Guarantor on or prior to the Outside Date.

         2.       Modification of Lease; Assignment and Subletting. Guarantor
agrees that the Lease and the Guaranteed Landlord Obligations may be
supplemented, amended and/or otherwise modified from time to time without
Guarantor's consent, in which event this Guaranty shall continue to apply to the
Lease and Guaranteed Landlord Obligations thereunder as so

                                  SCHEDULE 3 TO
                                    EXHIBIT C
                                       -1-

modified. In addition, no transfer of all or any portion of Landlord's interests
in the Lease shall impair or affect the continuing force of this Guaranty.

         3.       Guarantor Waivers. Guarantor hereby waives, to the fullest
extent allowed by law, all suretyship rights, defenses and other benefits to
which it might otherwise be entitled. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing:

                  (i)      Tenant shall be entitled to proceed against Guarantor
         with respect to any unfulfilled Guaranteed Landlord Obligations
         regardless of whether Tenant has proceeded, is then proceeding, or
         intends to proceed, against Landlord or any other person with respect
         thereto, and Guarantor expressly waives the benefits of Section 2845 of
         the Civil Code of California;

                  (ii)     Tenant shall not be required to furnish Guarantor
         with copies of any notices given or required to be given to Landlord
         under the Lease, including without limitation notices of default;

                  (iii)    Guarantor's liability for the Guaranteed Landlord
         Obligations shall not be affected, released, terminated, discharged or
         impaired by: (A) the existence of any bankruptcy, insolvency,
         reorganization or similar proceeding with respect to Landlord or any
         other person; (B) any exercise, non-exercise or delay or lack of
         diligence in the exercise of remedies by Tenant against Landlord or any
         other person of the applicable Guaranteed Landlord Obligation; (C) any
         assignment or other transfer (voluntary or involuntary) of Landlord's
         interests in the Lease; (D) the rejection of the Lease in any
         bankruptcy proceeding with respect to Landlord, or any other release or
         discharge of Landlord in any bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or
         similar proceeding; (E) any amendment of the Lease; (F) any change in
         the time, manner or place of payment, performance or observance of any
         of the Guaranteed Landlord Obligations; (G) any waiver of, or any
         assertion or enforcement or failure or refusal to assert or enforce, or
         any consent or indulgence granted by Tenant with respect to a departure
         from, any term of the Lease, including without limitation the waiver of
         any default by Landlord, or the making of any other arrangement with,
         or the accepting of any compensation or settlement from, Landlord; or
         (H) any other guaranty now or hereafter executed by Guarantor or any
         other guarantor or the release of any other guarantor from liability
         for the payment, performance or observance of any of the Guaranteed
         Landlord Obligations, whether by operation of law or otherwise; and

                  (iv)     Guarantor hereby expressly waives: (A) notice of
         acceptance of this Guaranty and of any change in the financial
         condition of Landlord; (B) presentment, demand and protest; (C) until
         such time as all defaulted Guaranteed Landlord Obligations are
         fulfilled, all right of subrogation with respect to any obligation of
         Landlord that is fulfilled by Guarantor hereunder; (D) the right to
         trial by jury in any action or proceeding arising out of or with
         respect to this Guaranty or the interpretation, breach or enforcement
         hereof; (E) the right to interpose any setoff or counterclaim in any
         action or proceeding arising out of or with respect to this Guaranty;
         and (F) any right or claim of right to cause a marshalling of the
         assets of Landlord or to cause Tenant to proceed against any collateral
         or security held by Tenant at any time or in any particular order.

                                  SCHEDULE 3 TO
                                    EXHIBIT C
                                       -2-

<PAGE>

The liability of Guarantor hereunder shall be reinstated and revived, and the
rights of Tenant under this Guaranty shall continue, with respect to any amount
at any time paid on account of any Guaranteed Landlord Obligations which shall
thereafter be required to be restored or returned by Tenant upon the bankruptcy,
insolvency or reorganization of Landlord or any other person, or otherwise, as
though such amount had not been paid. Guarantor subordinates any liability or
indebtedness of Landlord held by Guarantor to the Guaranteed Landlord
Obligations.

         4.       Jurisdiction. All disputes with respect to this Guaranty, and
all actions to enforce this Guaranty, may be adjudicated in the state courts of
California or the federal court sitting in California; and Guarantor hereby
irrevocably submits to the jurisdiction of such courts in any action relating to
this Guaranty. To the fullest extent permitted by law, this submission to
California jurisdiction shall be self-operative and no further instrument or
action, other than service of process, shall be required to confer jurisdiction
over Guarantor in any such court. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed
to limit the right of Tenant to serve process in any manner permitted by law or
to institute any action against Guarantor in the courts of other appropriate
jurisdictions.

         5.       Notices. All notices and other communications provided for in
this Guaranty shall be in writing and be delivered to the appropriate party at

result in the imposition or creation of any lien, charge or encumbrance on, or

the foregoing; and (ii) this Guaranty has been duly executed and delivered by
Guarantor and constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of Guarantor,

is unmodified and in full force and effect (or if modified, that it is in full
force and effect as modified and stating such modifications); and (ii) such
certified statement may be relied upon by anyone holding or proposing to acquire
from or through Tenant any interest in the Premises by any prospective assignee
or subtenant of Tenant.

         9.       Miscellaneous. This Guaranty shall: (i) remain in full force
and effect until the payment, performance and observance in full of all of the
Guaranteed Landlord Obligations and all other amounts payable under this
Guaranty; (ii) be binding upon Guarantor, its heirs, legal representatives,
successors and assigns; and (iii) inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by
Tenant and its successors and assigns or by any person to whom Tenant's interest
in the Lease or any part thereof, may be assigned. Wherever in this Guaranty
reference is made to Landlord or Tenant, the same shall be deemed to refer also
to the then heir, legal representative, successor or assign of Landlord or
Tenant, respectively. No provision of this Guaranty that is held to be
inoperative, unenforceable or otherwise invalid shall affect the remaining
provisions, and to this end all provisions hereof shall be severable. In the
event that more than one person or entity executes this Guaranty as Guarantor,
the obligations of each shall be joint and several. Time is of the essence of
this Guaranty. This Guaranty shall be governed by the laws of the State of
California. By accepting this Guaranty, Tenant agrees that it waives the right
to trial by jury in any action or proceeding arising out of or with respect to
this Guaranty or the interpretation, breach or enforcement hereof.

         1.1.     The right of possession of Tenant to the Premises and Tenant's
rights arising out of the Lease shall not be affected or disturbed by
Beneficiary in the exercise of any of its rights under the Deed of Trust or the
Note secured thereby.

         1.2.     Tenant shall not be named in any foreclosure action related to
the Deed of Trust, unless such joinder is necessary under applicable law to
foreclose the Deed of Trust, and then only for such purpose and not for the
purpose of terminating the Lease.

         1.3.     In the event that Beneficiary or any other person
("PURCHASER") acquires title to the Premises or succeeds to Landlord's interest
in the Lease pursuant to the exercise of any remedy provided for in the Deed of
Trust or under the laws of the state in which the Premises are located
(including any foreclosure of the Deed of Trust or conveyance in lieu of
foreclosure), the Lease shall not be terminated or affected by the exercise of
any such remedies or by said foreclosure or sale resulting from any such
proceedings; and Beneficiary hereby covenants that any acquisition or sale by it
of the Premises pursuant to the exercise of any rights and remedies under the
Deed of Trust or otherwise, shall be made subject to the Lease and the rights of
Tenant thereunder; and Tenant covenants and agrees to attorn to Beneficiary or
Purchaser as its new landlord; and the Lease shall continue in full force and
effect as a direct lease between Tenant and Beneficiary or Purchaser, as
Landlord, upon all the terms, covenants, conditions and agreements set forth in
the Lease between Tenant and Landlord. However, in no event shall Beneficiary or
Purchaser be:

                  1.3.1.   liable for any act or omission of Landlord, except
for those acts or omissions for which Tenant has given Beneficiary notice
thereof prior to said foreclosure or sale and which Beneficiary has thereafter
failed to cure within the time periods provided for in Paragraph 6 of this
Agreement (except that in no event shall Beneficiary be liable for any
incidental, special or consequential damages [including for property damage or
personal injury], that have accrued prior to said foreclosure or sale resulting
from any acts or omissions of any prior landlord [including Landlord] which
occurred prior to the date such notice was delivered to Beneficiary).
Beneficiary shall provide Tenant with written notice of any such foreclosure or
sale of the Premises as required by law, but in no event less than thirty (30)
days prior to such foreclosure or sale; or

                  1.3.2.   bound by any payment of rent made by Tenant more than
thirty (30) days in advance of the due date under the Lease or liable for any
security deposit unless actually received by Beneficiary or Lender; or

                  1.3.3.   subject to any offsets or defenses which Tenant may
have against any prior landlord (including Landlord) arising prior to said
foreclosure or sale, except for any defenses expressly provided for in the Lease
and any offset and abatement rights expressly provided in Paragraphs 1.5, 2.2,
12.6 and 18.2 of the Lease, provided that Tenant has given Beneficiary notice of
such offsets or defenses prior to said foreclosure or sale. Beneficiary shall
provide Tenant with written notice of any such foreclosure or sale of the
Premises as required by law, but in no event less than thirty (30) days prior to
such foreclosure or sale; or

                  1.3.4.   bound by any amendment to the Lease made subsequent
to the date of this Agreement without the written consent of Beneficiary, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or withheld for the purpose of
effectuating a change in terms to the Deed of Trust.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the rights and obligations of Tenant and
Beneficiary, respectively, upon such attornment shall, to the extent of the then
remaining balance of the term of the Lease, including any renewals or extensions
thereof, be the same as now set forth in the Lease and by this reference the
Lease is incorporated herein as part of this Agreement.

2.       The Lease shall be subject and subordinate to the lien of the Deed of
Trust and to all the terms, conditions and provisions thereof, to all advances
made or to be made thereunder, and to any renewals, extensions, modifications or
replacements thereof, not inconsistent with Paragraph 1 of this Agreement.

3.       Beneficiary hereby consents to the application of insurance and
property damage proceeds and condemnation proceeds in accordance with the
applicable provisions of Paragraphs 9, 10 and 12 of the Lease between Landlord
and Tenant (including, without limitation, the provisions of Paragraph 10.4.3 of
the Lease which permit disbursement of insurance proceeds to a beneficiary of
Landlord under a first deed of trust encumbering the Premises to apply towards
the repair of damage to the Premises), whether or not the Deed of Trust is then
foreclosed.

4.       Any notices or other communication required or desired to be given by
one party to the other party hereto shall be given in writing by (i) mailing the
same by certified or registered United States mail, return receipt requested,
postage prepaid, or (ii) sending the same by Federal Express or other comparable
overnight express courier service (with proof of receipt available), addressed
as follows:

documentation).

amounts due under the Lease have been assigned to Beneficiary as security for
the loan secured by the Deed

of Trust. In the event that Beneficiary shall notify Tenant that Landlord has
defaulted under the terms of the Deed of Trust and shall demand in writing that
Tenant pay its rent and all other amounts due under the Lease to Beneficiary,
then Tenant shall pay to Beneficiary all rent and other payments required to be
paid by Tenant to Landlord pursuant to the terms of the Lease for the duration
of the Lease. Such amounts payable by Tenant to Beneficiary shall include only
those payments which become due to Landlord under the terms of the Lease after
the time Tenant has received written notice and demand from Beneficiary as
provided in this Paragraph 5; provided, however, Tenant shall not be liable to
Beneficiary for any payments made to Landlord under the terms of the Lease for
the fifteen (15) business day period following such notice and demand from
Beneficiary, such fifteen (15) business day period being deemed by the parties
hereto to be a reasonable period to permit Tenant to implement any such payment
change. Landlord hereby agrees that, in complying with the provisions of this
Paragraph 5, Tenant shall be entitled to rely solely upon the notices given by
Beneficiary, and Landlord agrees to indemnify, defend, protect and hold Tenant
harmless from and against any and all loss, claim, damage or liability arising
out of Tenant's payment to Beneficiary in compliance with such notice. Landlord
hereby releases and forever discharges Tenant from any all liability for losses
suffered by Landlord as a result of Tenant's compliance with the provisions of
this Paragraph 5, and Tenant shall be entitled to full credit under the Lease
for any rents or other amounts paid to Beneficiary in accordance with this
Paragraph 5 to the same extent as if such payments were made directly to
Landlord. Any dispute between Beneficiary or Purchaser and Landlord as to the
existence or continuance of a default by Landlord under the terms of the Deed of
Trust or the Note secured thereby, or with respect to the extent or nature of
such default, or with respect to foreclosure of the Deed of Trust by
Beneficiary, shall be dealt with and adjusted solely between Beneficiary or
Purchaser and Landlord, and Tenant shall not be made a party thereto.

6.       So long as the Deed of Trust remains an encumbrance against the
Premises, Tenant agrees to concurrently provide Beneficiary with a copy of any
notice of default served upon Landlord. Tenant further agrees that if Landlord
shall have failed to cure such default within the time period provided for in
the Lease, and if such default is curable by Beneficiary, then Beneficiary shall
have the right, at its election, to cure said Landlord default within thirty
(30) days following the expiration of Landlord's cure period, or, in the case of
any non-monetary default which cannot be cured within said 30-day period, to
promptly commence such cure within said 30-day period and thereafter diligently
prosecute same to completion, which completion period shall not exceed one
hundred twenty (120) days. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Tenant may proceed
immediately to cure or cause to be cured any default of Landlord pursuant to the
provisions of the Lease. Any failure by Tenant to give such duplicate notice to
Beneficiary shall not be a default by Tenant either under this Agreement or
under the Lease; provided, however, until such time as Beneficiary has received
such duplicate notice from Tenant and has had a opportunity to cure such default
as required under this Paragraph 6, Tenant shall have no right to (i) terminate
the Lease as a result of Landlord's default or (ii) exercise any offset rights
Tenant may have resulting from such default. Notwithstanding the foregoing
sentence, if any repair or maintenance matter for which Landlord is responsible
is of an emergency nature which if not attended to might result in bodily injury
or damage to Tenant's property, Tenant may make such repair (as provided in
Paragraph 7.2 of the Lease) without prior notice to Beneficiary, and such action
by Tenant shall not waive or limit Tenant's offset and defense rights under
Paragraph 1.3.3 above. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, nothing
herein shall prohibit Tenant from exercising any termination rights it may have
under the

Lease (including under Articles 9 and 12 of the Lease) which are not predicated
upon a default of Landlord.

7.       If Beneficiary or Purchaser, by succeeding to the interest of the
landlord under the Lease, shall become obligated to perform the covenants of the
landlord thereunder, then, upon further transfer of the landlord's interest in
the Lease by Beneficiary or Purchaser and provided that the transferee shall
have assumed in writing all of the obligations of the landlord under the Lease
from and after the time of such transfer, all such landlord obligations shall
terminate as to Beneficiary or Purchaser, except for those obligations which
have accrued prior to such transfer.

8.       This Agreement may not be modified other than by an agreement in
writing signed by the parties hereto or by their respective successors in
interest.

9.       This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the
parties hereto and their successors and assigns.

10.      The foregoing provisions shall be self operative and effective without
the execution of any further instruments on the part of either party hereto.

11.      Should Beneficiary cease to have a beneficial interest under the Deed
of Trust, Beneficiary shall give prompt written notice to Tenant of the
reconveyance, assignment or other form of termination of said beneficial
interest.

12.      This Agreement may be executed in multiple counterparts, each of which
shall constitute an original, but all of which taken together shall constitute
one and the same agreement.
