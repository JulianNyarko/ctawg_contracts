effective, a designation of beneficiary must be completed by the Participant on the Designation of Beneficiary form and received by the Company, or its designee, prior to the date of the Participant&#146;s death. If the Participant dies without such
designation, the Restricted Stock Units will become part of the Participant&#146;s estate. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">5. <U>Dividend Equivalents</U>. In
the event the Company declares a dividend on Shares (as defined in the Plan), for each unvested Restricted Stock Unit on the dividend payment date, the Participant shall be credited with a Dividend Equivalent, payable in cash, with a value equal to
the value of the declared dividend. The Dividend Equivalents shall be subject to the same restrictions as the unvested Restricted Stock Units to which they relate. No interest or other earnings shall be credited on the Dividend Equivalents. Subject
to continued employment with the Company and Affiliates, the restrictions with respect to the Dividend Equivalents shall lapse at the same time and in the same proportion as the initial award of Restricted Stock Units. No additional Dividend
Equivalents shall be accrued for the benefit of the Participant with respect to record dates occurring prior to, or with respect to record dates occurring on or after the date, if any, on which the Participant has forfeited the Restricted Stock
Units or any Restricted Stock Units have been settled. For any specified employee, any Dividend Equivalents subject to Code Section&nbsp;409A and payable upon a termination of employment shall be subject to a six month delay. The Dividend
Equivalents shall be subject to all such other provisions set forth herein, and may be used to satisfy any or all obligations for the payment of any tax attributable to the Dividend Equivalents and/or Restricted Stock Units. </FONT></P>

underlying Shares), or as of which the value of any Restricted Stock Units first becomes includible in the Participant&#146;s gross income for income tax purposes, the Participant shall satisfy all obligations for the payment of any tax attributable
to the Restricted Stock Units. The Participant shall notify the Company if the Participant wishes to pay the Company in cash, check or with shares of WellPoint common stock already owned for the satisfaction of any taxes of any kind required by law
to be withheld with respect to such Restricted Stock Units. Any such election made by the Participant must be irrevocable, made in writing, signed by the Participant, and shall be subject to any restrictions or limitations that the Compensation
Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company (&#147;Committee&#148;), in its sole discretion, deems appropriate. If the Participant does not notify the Company in writing at least 14 days prior to the applicable lapse of the Period of
Restriction, the Committee is authorized to take any such other action as may be necessary or appropriate, as determined by the Committee, to satisfy all obligations for the payment of such taxes. Such other actions may include withholding the
required amounts from other compensation payable to the Participant, a sell-to-cover transaction or such other method determined by the Committee, in its discretion. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT

the employment or service of the Company or any Affiliate for any period, nor restrict in any way the right of the Company, which right is hereby expressly reserved, to terminate the Participant&#146;s employment or service at any time for any
reason. The Participant acknowledges and agrees that any right to have restrictions on the Restricted Stock Units lapse is earned only by continuing as an employee of the Company or an Affiliate at the will of the Company or such Affiliate, or
satisfaction of any other applicable terms and conditions contained in the Plan and this Agreement, and not through the act of being hired, being granted the Restricted Stock Units or acquiring Shares hereunder. </FONT></P>

reference, and to such regulations as may from time to time be adopted by the Committee. Unless defined herein, capitalized terms are as defined in the Plan. In the event of any conflict between the provisions of the Plan and this Agreement, the
provisions of the Plan shall control, and this Agreement shall be deemed to be modified accordingly. The Plan and the prospectus describing the Plan can be found on the Company&#146;s HR intranet. A paper copy of the Plan and the prospectus shall be

determine to be necessary or applicable. Moreover, the Company shall not deliver any certificates for Shares to the Participant or any other person pursuant to this Agreement if doing so would be contrary to applicable law. If at any time the
Company determines, in its discretion, that the listing, registration or qualification of Shares upon any national securities exchange or under any state or Federal law, or the consent or approval of any governmental regulatory body, is necessary or
desirable, the Company shall not be required to deliver any certificates for Shares to the Participant or any other person pursuant to this Agreement unless and until such listing, registration, qualification, consent or approval has been effected

Rule 144 under the Securities Act (&#147;Rule 144&#148;), the Participant may not sell the Shares received except in compliance with Rule 144. Certificates representing Shares issued to an &#147;affiliate&#148; of the Company may bear a legend

any kind of such Shares shall be made only pursuant to either (i)&nbsp;a registration statement on an appropriate form under the Securities Act, which registration statement has become effective and is current with regard to the Shares being offered
