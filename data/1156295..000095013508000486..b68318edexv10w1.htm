employment hereunder other than for Cause at any time upon thirty (30)&nbsp;days&#146; notice to the
Executive, provided that the Company may in its discretion relieve the Executive of all duties and
responsibilities during such thirty day period. In the event of such termination, in addition to
Final Compensation and provided that no benefits are payable to the Executive under a separate
severance agreement as a result of such termination, then until the conclusion of a period of six
(6)&nbsp;months following the date of termination, the Company shall continue to pay the Executive the
Base Salary at the rate in effect on the date of termination. Any obligation of the Company to the
Executive hereunder, other than for Final Compensation, is conditioned, however, on the Executive
signing and return of a timely and effective release of claims in the form attached to this
Agreement as <U>Exhibit&nbsp;A</U> (the &#147;<U>Employee Release</U>&#148;) and delivering it to the Company
within thirty (30)&nbsp;calendar days of the date his employment terminates. Severance Pay to which the
Executive is entitled hereunder shall be payable in accordance with the normal payroll practices of
the Company, with the first payment, which shall be retroactive to the day immediately following
the date the Executive&#146;s employment terminated, being due and payable on the Company&#146;s next regular
payday for executives that follows the expiration of thirty (30)&nbsp;calendar days from the date the
Executive&#146;s employment terminates. The Release of Claims required for separation benefits in
accordance with this Section 4(d) creates legally binding obligations on the part of the Executive
and the Company and its Affiliates therefore advise the Executive to seek the advice of an attorney
before signing it.

time upon thirty (30)&nbsp;days&#146; notice to the Company, unless such termination would violate any
obligation of the Executive to the Company under a separate severance agreement. In the event of
termination of the Executive pursuant to this Section&nbsp;4(e), the Company may elect to waive the
period of notice, or any portion thereof, and, if the Company so elects, the Company will pay the
Executive his Base Salary for the initial thirty (30)&nbsp;days of the notice period (or for any
remaining portion of such period). The Company shall have no further obligation to the Executive,
other than for any Final Compensation due to him.

Executive is a &#147;specified employee,&#148; as hereinafter defined, any and all amounts payable under this
Section&nbsp;4 in connection with such separation from service that constitute deferred compensation
subject to Section&nbsp;409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, (&#147;<U>Section&nbsp;409A</U>&#148;),
as determined by the Company in its sole discretion, and that would (but for this sentence) be
payable within six months following such separation from service, shall instead be paid on the date
that follows the date of such separation from service by six (6)&nbsp;months. For purposes of the
preceding sentence, &#147;separation from service&#148; shall be determined in a manner consistent with
subsection (a)(2)(A)(i) of Section&nbsp;409A and the term &#147;specified employee&#148; shall mean an individual
determined by the Company to be a specified employee as defined in subsection (a)(2)(B)(i) of
Section&nbsp;409A.

and considered all the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including the restraints imposed
upon him pursuant to Sections&nbsp;6, 7 and 8 hereof. The Executive agrees without reservation that
each of the restraints contained herein is necessary for the reasonable and proper protection of
the goodwill, Confidential Information and other legitimate interests of the Company and its
Affiliates; that each and every one of those restraints is reasonable in respect to subject matter,
length of time and geographic area; and that these restraints, individually or in the aggregate,
will not prevent &#091;him&#093; from obtaining other suitable employment during the period in which the
Executive is bound by these restraints. The Executive further agrees that he will never assert, or
permit to be asserted on his behalf, in any forum, any position contrary to the foregoing. The
Executive further acknowledges that, were he to breach any of the covenants contained in Sections
6, 7 or 8 hereof, the damage to the Company would be irreparable. The Executive therefore agrees
that the Company, in addition to any other remedies available to it, shall be entitled to
preliminary and permanent injunctive relief against any breach or threatened breach by the
Executive of any of said covenants, without having to post bond and shall be entitled to recover
its reasonable attorneys&#146; fees and costs incurred in securing such relief. The parties further
agree that, in the event that any provision of Sections&nbsp;6, 7 or 8 hereof shall be determined by any
court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable by reason of its being extended over too great
a time, too large a geographic area or too great a range of activities, such provision shall be
deemed to be modified to permit its enforcement to the maximum extent permitted by law. The
parties also agree that the periods of time set forth in Sections&nbsp;8(a), 8(c) and 8(d) shall be
tolled, and shall not run, during any period the Executive is in breach of the covenants contained
therein so that the Company may enjoy the full protection of such covenants.

execution of this Agreement and the performance of his obligations hereunder will not breach or be
in conflict with any other agreement to which the Executive is a party or is bound and that the
Executive is not now subject to any covenants against competition or similar covenants or any court
order or other legal obligation that would affect the performance of his obligations
