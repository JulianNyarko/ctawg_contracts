Contractors of the Employer may elect to defer receipt of current Compensation from the Employer in order to provide retirement and other benefits on behalf of such Employees or Independent Contractors of the Employer, as selected in the Adoption
Agreement. The Plan is intended to be a nonqualified deferred compensation plan that complies with the provisions of Section&nbsp;409A of the Internal Revenue Code (the &#147;Code&#148;). The Plan is also intended to be an unfunded plan maintained
primarily for the purpose of providing deferred compensation benefits for a select group of management or highly compensated employees under Sections 201(2), 301(a)(3) and 401(a)(l) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974
(&#147;ERISA&#148;) and independent contractors. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan, this Plan shall be interpreted, operated and administered in a manner consistent with these intentions. </FONT></P>
