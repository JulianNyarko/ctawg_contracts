1993 (the &#147;Effective Date&#148;) by Chicago Mercantile Exchange, an Illinois not-for-profit corporation (&#147;CME&#148;)), to provide its eligible key management employees with an opportunity to receive additional retirement income. Pursuant
to a series of demutualization transactions and an agreement and plan of merger, effective as of November&nbsp;13, 2000, Chicago Mercantile Exchange Inc., a shareholder-owned, for-profit Delaware corporation (the &#147;Exchange&#148;) succeeded to
the assets, liabilities and business of CME and to the power, authority and responsibility of CME under and with respect to the Plan. Effective as of December&nbsp;3, 2001, pursuant to a further corporate reorganization, the Exchange became a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Chicago Mercantile Exchange Holdings Inc. (&#147;CME Holdings&#148;). The Plan is intended to constitute a plan maintained primarily for the purpose of providing deferred compensation for a select group of management or
highly compensated employees within the meaning of Section&nbsp;201(2), 301(a)(3) and 401(a)(l) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (&#147;ERISA&#148;). </FONT></P> <P

interested person the names of the employees of the Exchange who are, from time to time, authorized to act on behalf of the Plan Administrator and who are responsible for the day-to-day operation and administration of the Plan. The Plan

interest in, any assets of the Exchange or to any investment reserves, accounts, trusts or funds that the Exchange may purchase, establish or accumulate to aid in providing the benefits under the Plan, and any rights of such individuals under the
Plan or any such reserves, accounts, trusts or funds shall constitute unsecured contractual rights only. Nothing contained in the Plan shall constitute a guarantee by the Exchange that the assets of the Exchange shall be sufficient to pay any

shall be determined without regard to taxes that would be payable with respect to any assumed investment. The Plan Administrator may eliminate any assumed investment alternative at any time; provided, however, that the Plan Administrator may not

such installments are to be paid. Except as otherwise provided in this Section&nbsp;4, a Participant&#146;s Payment Election shall be irrevocable. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"

Any such request shall be subject to the approval of the Plan Administrator, which approval (a)&nbsp;shall only be granted to the extent reasonably needed to satisfy the need created by the Unforeseeable Emergency, and (b)&nbsp;shall not be granted
to the extent that such need may be relieved (i)&nbsp;through reimbursement or compensation by insurance or otherwise or (ii)&nbsp;by liquidation of the Participant&#146;s assets (to the extent the liquidation of such assets would not itself cause
severe financial hardship). </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:8%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">(b) An &#147;Unforeseeable Emergency&#148; means a severe financial hardship of the Participant or beneficiary
resulting from an illness or accident of the Participant or his or her spouse or dependent (as defined in Section&nbsp;152(a) of the Code), loss of the Participant&#146;s property due to casualty (including the need to rebuild a home following
damage to a home not otherwise covered by insurance), or other similar extraordinary and unforeseeable circumstances arising as a result of events beyond the Participant&#146;s control. Circumstances that may constitute an Unforeseeable Emergency
include the imminent foreclosure of or eviction from the Participant&#146;s primary residence; the need to pay for medical expenses, including non-refundable deductibles, as well as for the costs of prescription drug medication; and the need to pay
for the funeral expenses of a spouse or a dependent (as defined in Section&nbsp;152(a) of the Code). The purchase of a home and the payment of college tuition generally are not Unforeseeable Emergencies. Whether the Participant is faced with an
Unforeseeable Emergency permitting an emergency withdrawal shall be determined by the Plan Administrator in its sole discretion, based on the relevant facts and circumstances and applying regulations and other guidance under Section&nbsp;409A of the
Code. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:8%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">4.7. <U>Designation of Beneficiary</U>. Each Participant may from time to time, by signing a form furnished by the Plan

designation form will be effective only when the signed form is filed with the Plan Administrator while the Participant is alive and will cancel all beneficiary designation forms with respect to the Plan filed earlier. Except as otherwise
specifically provided in this Section&nbsp;4.7, if a deceased Participant failed to designate a beneficiary as provided above, or if the designated beneficiary of a deceased Participant dies before him or before complete payment of the
