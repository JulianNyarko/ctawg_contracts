or future rights that I might have with respect to Company and the Released Parties. Once in effect, this Agreement is a legally admissible and binding agreement. It shall not be construed strictly for or against me, Company, or any Released Party.

representations not in this Agreement or the Consulting Agreement. Company would not have agreed to enter into the Consulting Agreement or to provide me the benefits and payments thereunder or hereunder but for the representations and promises I am
making by entering into this Agreement. I have not suffered any job-related wrongs or injuries, such as any type of discrimination, for which I might still be entitled to compensation or relief now or in the future. I have been paid all
compensation, benefits, and other amounts that Company or any Released Party should have paid me in the past. </FONT></P>

or if I initially was uncomfortable making it, I resolved all my doubts and concerns before signing this Agreement. I have carefully read this Agreement, I fully understand what it means, I am entering into it knowingly and voluntarily, and all my
representations in it are true. The consideration period described in the box above my signature started when I first was given this Agreement, and I waive any right to have it restarted or extended by any subsequent changes to this Agreement.
