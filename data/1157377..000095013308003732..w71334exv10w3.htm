determining the value of each RSU is $<U>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</U>. At such time as the RSU
becomes payable to you, the award may be settled all or partly in cash or all or partly in
shares of Common Stock, as will be determined in the sole discretion of the Administrator of
the Plan at such time. In addition, the award to be paid to you will be subject to applicable
Federal and local tax withholding. When the RSU becomes payable to you, the resulting
compensation will <U>not</U> increase or otherwise affect your benefits under any other
benefit program maintained by the Company.</TD>

upon the vesting provisions associated with the RSU. Subject to the Tax Deferral Opportunity
discussion set forth in (4)&nbsp;below, your RSU&#146;s will be paid to you as they become vested. In
the event that you terminate employment or are no longer in the service of the Company for any
reason other than (i)&nbsp;death while in the employ of the Company or any Subsidiary or serving as
a member of the Board, (ii)&nbsp;on account of Total and Permanent Disablement, or (iii)&nbsp;a
termination of employment within one year after a Change of Control of the Company (as such
terms are defined in the Standard Terms and Conditions or the Plan) for any reason other than
for Cause (as defined in the Standard Terms and Conditions), Retirement or voluntary
resignation by the Participant, all of your previously unvested RSU&#146;s will be forfeited. If
your employment or service with the Company was terminated for one of the three reasons set
forth above, your previously unvested RSU&#146;s would become fully vested as of the date of the
termination of employment or service and, subject to the deferral features set forth below,
you will receive a payment in respect of the RSU&#146;s based upon their value at the time of your
termination of employment or service. If you are a &#147;key employee&#148;, as defined in applicable
Federal tax law, the Company shall be entitled to defer payment to you for six months
following the date of your termination of employment.</TD>
