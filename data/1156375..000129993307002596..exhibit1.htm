primary beneficiary a family member of a Participant. Each such designation shall revoke all prior
designations by the Participant and shall be effective only if given in a form and manner
acceptable to the Committee. In the absence of any such designation, any vested benefits remaining
unpaid at the Participant&#146;s death shall be paid to the Participant&#146;s estate and, subject to the
terms of the Plan and of the applicable Award Agreement, any unexercised vested Award may be
exercised by the administrator or executor of the Participant&#146;s estate.

to an Award other than an Incentive Stock Option, no Award granted under the Plan may be sold,
transferred, pledged, assigned, or otherwise alienated or hypothecated, other than by will, by the
laws of descent and distribution, or to the limited extent provided in Section&nbsp;9.5. All rights with
respect to an Award granted to a Participant shall be available during his or her lifetime only to
the Participant and may be exercised only by the Participant or the Participant&#146;s legal
representative.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; text-indent: 3%"><B>9.7. </B><B><I>No Rights as Stockholder. </I></B>Except to the limited extent provided in Sections&nbsp;7.6 and 7.7,
no Participant (nor any beneficiary) shall have any of the rights or privileges of a stockholder of
the Company with respect to any Shares issuable pursuant to an Award (or exercise thereof), unless
and until certificates representing such Shares shall have been issued, recorded on the records of
the Company or its transfer agents or registrars, and delivered to the Participant (or
beneficiary).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; text-indent: 3%"><B>9.8. </B><B><I>Withholding Requirements. </I></B>Prior to the delivery of any Shares or cash pursuant to an
Award (or exercise thereof), the Company shall have the power and the right to deduct (including,
but not limited to, deduction through a broker-assisted cashless exercise) or withhold, or require
a Participant to remit to the Company, an amount sufficient to satisfy federal, state, local and
foreign taxes (including, but not limited to, the Participant&#146;s FICA and SDI obligations) required
to be withheld with respect to such Award (or exercise thereof). Notwithstanding any contrary
provision of the Plan, if a Participant fails to remit to the Company such withholding amount
within the time period specified by the Committee (in its discretion), the Participant&#146;s Award may,
in the Committee&#146;s discretion, be forfeited and in such case the Participant shall not receive any
of the Shares subject to such Award.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; text-indent: 3%"><B>9.9. </B><B><I>Withholding Arrangements. </I></B>The Committee, in its sole discretion and pursuant to such
procedures as it may specify from time to time, may permit or require a Participant to satisfy all
or part of the minimum tax withholding obligations in connection with an Award by (a)&nbsp;having the
Company withhold otherwise deliverable Shares, or (b)&nbsp;delivering to the Company already-owned
Shares having a Fair Market Value equal to the amount required to be withheld.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; text-indent: 3%"><B>9.10. </B><B><I>Deferrals. </I></B>The Committee, in its sole discretion, may permit a Participant to defer
receipt of the payment of cash or the delivery of Shares that would otherwise be delivered to a
Participant under the Plan. Any such deferral elections shall be subject to such rules and
procedures as shall be determined by the Committee in its sole discretion and shall be done in a
manner so as not to result in taxation under Section&nbsp;409A of the Code.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; text-indent: 3%"><B>9.11. </B><B><I>Change of Control. </I></B>(a)(1) Notwithstanding any provision in this Plan or any Award
Agreement, in the event of a Change of Control pursuant to paragraphs (c)&nbsp;or (d)&nbsp;of Section&nbsp;2.8 in
connection with which the holders of Shares receive shares of common stock that are registered
under Section&nbsp;12 of the 1934 Act, (i)&nbsp;all outstanding Options and SARs shall immediately become
exercisable in full, (ii)&nbsp;the Period of Restriction applicable to any outstanding Restricted Stock
Award shall lapse, (iii)&nbsp;the Performance Period applicable to any outstanding Performance Share
shall lapse, (iv)&nbsp;the Performance Goals applicable to any outstanding award shall be deemed to be
satisfied at the maximum level and (v)&nbsp;there shall be substituted for each Share available under
this Plan, whether or not then subject to an outstanding award, the number and class of shares into
which each outstanding Share shall be converted pursuant to such Change of Control. In the event of
any such substitution, the purchase price per share in the case of an Option and the base price in
the case of an SAR shall be appropriately adjusted by the Committee (whose determination shall be
final, binding and conclusive), such adjustments to be made in the case of outstanding Options and
SARs without an increase in the aggregate purchase price or base price.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:3%; font-size: 10pt; text-indent: 2%">(2)&nbsp;Notwithstanding any provision in this Plan or any Award Agreement, in the event of a
Change of Control pursuant to paragraph (a)&nbsp;or (b)&nbsp;of Section&nbsp;2.8, or in the event of a Change
of Control pursuant to paragraph (c)&nbsp;or (d)&nbsp;of Section&nbsp;2.8 in connection with which the
holders of Shares receive consideration other than shares of common stock that are registered
under Section&nbsp;12 of the 1934 Act, each outstanding Award shall be surrendered to the Company
by the holder thereof, and each such Award shall immediately be canceled by the Company, and
the holder shall receive, within ten days of the occurrence of a Change of Control, a cash
payment from the Company in an amount equal to (i)&nbsp;in the case of an Option, the number of
Shares then subject to such Option, multiplied by the excess, if any, of the greater of
(A)&nbsp;the highest per Share price offered to stockholders of the Company in any transaction
whereby the Change of Control takes place or (B)&nbsp;the Fair Market Value of a Share on the date
of occurrence of the Change of Control, over the purchase price per Share subject to the
Option, (ii)&nbsp;in the case of an SAR other than a tandem SAR, the number of Shares then subject
to such SAR, multiplied by the excess, if any, of the greater of (A)&nbsp;the highest per Share
price offered to stockholders of the Company in any transaction whereby the Change of Control
takes place or (B)&nbsp;the Fair Market Value of a Share on the date of occurrence of the Change of
Control, over the base price of the SAR, (iii)&nbsp;in the case of a Restricted Stock Award or
Performance Share Award, the number of Shares or the number of Performance Shares, as the case
may be, then subject to such Award, multiplied by the greater of (A)&nbsp;the highest per Share
price offered to stockholders of the Company in any transaction whereby the Change of Control
takes place or (B)&nbsp;the Fair Market Value of a Share on the date of occurrence of the Change of
Control.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:3%; font-size: 10pt; text-indent: 2%">In the event of a Change of Control, each tandem SAR shall be surrendered by the holder
thereof and shall be canceled simultaneously with the cancellation of the related Option. The
Company may, but is not required to, cooperate with any person who is subject to Section&nbsp;16 of
the Exchange Act to assure that any cash payment in accordance with the foregoing to such
person is made in compliance with Section&nbsp;16 and the rules and regulations thereunder.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; text-indent: 3%"><B>9.12. </B><B><I>Restrictions on Shares. </I></B>Each Award made hereunder shall be subject to the requirement
that if an any time the Company determines that the listing, registration or qualification of the
Shares subject to such Award upon any securities exchange or under a any law, or the consent or
approval of any governmental body, or the taking of any other action is necessary or desirable as a
condition of, or in connection with, the exercise or settlement of such Award or the delivery of
Shares thereunder, such Award shall not be exercised or settled and such Shares shall not be
delivered unless such listing, registration, qualification, consent, approval or other action shall
have been effected or obtained, free of any conditions not acceptable to the Company. The Company
may require that certificates evidencing shares delivered pursuant to any Award made hereunder bear
