be able to transfer or sell any of the shares of Common Stock issued to the Participant pursuant to this Agreement unless exemptions from registration or filings under applicable securities laws are available. Furthermore, despite registration,
applicable securities laws may restrict the ability of the Participant to resell his or her Common Stock, including due to the Participant&#146;s affiliation with the Company. The Company shall not be obligated to either issue the Common Stock or
permit the resale of any shares of Common Stock if such issuance or resale would violate any applicable securities law, rule or regulation. </P>

responsibility. Without limiting the foregoing, the Participant agrees that if under applicable law the Participant will owe taxes at each vesting date on the portion of the Award then vested the Company shall be entitled to immediate payment from
the Participant of the amount of any tax required to be withheld by the Company. Any taxes due shall be paid, at the option of the Company as follows: </P>

equal to the amount of minimum withholding tax due and payable by the Company. Fractional shares will not be retained to satisfy any portion of the withholding tax. Accordingly, the Participant agrees that in the event that the amount of withholding
tax owed would result in a fraction of a share being owed, that amount will be satisfied by withholding the fractional amount from the Participant&#146;s paycheck; </P>

registered broker to sell to satisfy the Company&#146;s withholding obligation, after deduction of the broker&#146;s commission, and the broker shall be required to remit to the Company the cash necessary in order for the Company to satisfy its
withholding obligation. To the extent the proceeds of such sale exceed the Company&#146;s tax withholding obligation the Company agrees to pay such excess cash to the Participant as soon as practicable. In addition, if such sale is not sufficient to
pay the Company&#146;s tax withholding obligation the Participant agrees to pay to the Company as soon as practicable, including through additional payroll withholding, the amount of any tax withholding obligation that is not satisfied by the sale
