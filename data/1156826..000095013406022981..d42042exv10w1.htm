<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.1. <U>Purpose</U>. The Archstone-Smith Trust 2001 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the &#147;Plan&#148;)
has been established by Archstone-Smith Trust (the &#147;Company&#148;) to (i)&nbsp;attract and retain persons
eligible to participate in the Plan; (ii)&nbsp;motivate Participants, by means of appropriate
incentives, to achieve long-range goals; (iii)&nbsp;provide incentive compensation opportunities that
are competitive with those of other similar companies; and (iv)&nbsp;further identify Participants&#146;
interests with those of the Company&#146;s other shareholders through compensation that is based on the
Company&#146;s common shares; and thereby promote the long-term financial interest of the Company and
the Subsidiaries, including the growth in value of the Company&#146;s equity and enhancement of
long-term shareholder return.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.2. <U>Participation</U>. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan, the Committee
shall determine and designate, from time to time, from among the Eligible Individuals (including
transferees of Eligible Individuals to the extent the transfer is permitted by the Plan and the
applicable Award Agreement), those persons who will be granted one or more Awards under the Plan,
and thereby become &#147;Participants&#148; in the Plan. Individuals who receive a grant of Replacement
Awards pursuant to Section&nbsp;4 shall also be considered Participants in the Plan with respect to such
Awards.

Option or SAR Award) may provide the Participant with the right to receive dividend payments,
dividend equivalent payments or dividend equivalent units with respect to Shares subject to the
Award (both before and after the Shares subject to the Award is earned, vested, or acquired), which
payments may be either made currently or credited to an account for the Participant, and may be
settled in cash or Shares, as determined by the Committee. Any such settlements, and any such
crediting of dividends or dividend equivalents or reinvestment in Shares or Share equivalents, may
be subject to such conditions, restrictions and contingencies as the Committee shall establish,
including the reinvestment of such credited amounts in Shares equivalents.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.7. <U>Settlement of Awards</U>. The obligation to make payments and distributions with
respect to Awards may be satisfied through cash payments, the delivery of Shares, the granting of
replacement Awards, or combination thereof as the Committee shall determine. Satisfaction of any
such obligations under an Award, which is sometimes referred to as &#147;settlement&#148; of the Award, may
be subject to such conditions, restrictions and contingencies as the Committee shall determine.
The Committee may permit or require the deferral of any Award payment, subject to such rules and
procedures as it may establish, which may include provisions for the payment or crediting of
interest or dividend equivalents, and may include converting such credits into deferred Share
equivalents. Each Subsidiary shall be liable for payment of cash due under the Plan with respect
to any Participant to the extent that such benefits are attributable to the services rendered for
that Subsidiary by the Participant. Any disputes relating to liability of a Subsidiary for cash
payments shall be resolved by the Committee.

Committee at such times, in such form, and subject to such restrictions and limitations, not
inconsistent with the terms of the Plan, as the Committee shall require.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.10. <U>Agreement With Company</U>. An Award under the Plan shall be subject to such terms
and conditions, not inconsistent with the Plan, as the Committee shall, in its sole discretion,
prescribe. The terms and conditions of any Award to any Participant shall be reflected in such
form of written document, if any, as is determined by the Committee. A copy of such document shall
be provided to the Participant, and the Committee may, but need not require that the Participant
sign a copy of such document. Such document is referred to in the Plan as an &#147;Award Agreement&#148;
regardless of whether any Participant signature is required.
