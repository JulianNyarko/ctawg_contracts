of Credit) or to ascertain or inquire as to the validity or accuracy of any such document or the
authority of the Person executing or delivering any such document. None of the L/C Issuer, the

None of the L/C Issuer, the Administrative Agent, any of their respective Related Parties nor any
correspondent, participant or assignee of the L/C Issuer shall be liable or responsible for any of

the excess of (x)&nbsp;such aggregate Outstanding Amount over (y)&nbsp;the total amount of funds, if any,

<U>times</U> the daily Stated Amount under each such Letter of Credit (whether or not such maximum
amount is then in effect under such Letter of Credit). For purposes of computing the daily amount
available to be drawn under any Letter of Credit, the amount of the Letter of Credit shall be

payable on the first day after the end of each month commencing with the first such date to occur
after the issuance of such Letter of Credit, on the Letter of Credit Expiration Date and thereafter
on demand, and (ii)&nbsp;computed on a monthly basis in arrears. If there is any change in the
Applicable Margin during any quarter, the daily amount available to be drawn under of each Letter
of Credit shall be computed and multiplied by the Applicable Margin separately for each period
during such quarter that such Applicable Margin was in effect. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, while any Event of Default exists, all Letter of Credit Fees shall
accrue at the Default Rate as provided in <U>Section&nbsp;2.12(b)</U> hereof unless all outstanding

(the &#147;<U>Fronting Fee</U>&#148;) (i)&nbsp;with respect to each Commercial Letter of Credit, at a rate equal
to 0.125% per annum, computed on the amount of such Letter of Credit, and payable upon the issuance
or amendment thereof, and (ii)&nbsp;with respect to each Standby Letter of Credit, at a rate equal to

after the end of each month, commencing with the first such date to occur after the issuance of
such Letter of Credit, on the Letter of Credit Expiration Date and thereafter on demand. For
purposes of computing the daily amount available to be drawn under any Letter of Credit, the amount

time on any Business Day during the Availability Period in an aggregate amount not to exceed at any
time outstanding the amount of the Swing Line Sublimit, notwithstanding the fact that such Swing
Line Loans, when aggregated with the Applicable Percentage of the Outstanding Amount of Committed
Loans and L/C Obligations of the Lender acting as Swing Line Lender, may exceed the amount of such
Lender&#146;s Commitment; <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that after giving effect to any Swing Line
Loan, (i)&nbsp;the Total Outstandings shall not exceed the Loan Cap, and (ii)&nbsp;the aggregate Outstanding

shall not use the proceeds of any Swing Line Loan to refinance any outstanding Swing Line Loan, and
<U>provided further that</U> the Swing Line Lender shall not be obligated to make any Swing Line
Loan at any time when any Lender is at such time a Defaulting Lender or Deteriorating Lender
hereunder, unless the Swing Line Lender has entered into satisfactory arrangements with the
Borrower or such Lender to eliminate the Swing Line Lender&#146;s risk with respect to such Lender.
Within the foregoing limits, and subject to the other terms and conditions hereof, the Borrowers
may borrow under this <U>Section&nbsp;2.04</U>, prepay under <U>Section&nbsp;2.05</U>, and reborrow under
this <U>Section&nbsp;2.04</U>. Each Swing Line Loan shall bear interest only at a rate based on the
Base Rate. Immediately upon the making of a Swing Line Loan, each Lender shall be deemed to, and
hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees to, purchase from the Swing Line Lender a risk
participation in such Swing Line Loan in an amount equal to the product of such Lender&#146;s Applicable
Percentage <I>multiplied by </I>the amount of such Swing Line Loan. The Swing Line Lender shall have all

given by telephone. Each such notice must be received by the Swing Line Lender and the
Administrative Agent not later than 2:00 p.m. on the requested borrowing date, and shall specify
(i)&nbsp;the amount to be borrowed, which shall be a minimum of $100,000, and (ii)&nbsp;the requested
borrowing date, which shall be a Business Day. Each such telephonic notice must be confirmed
promptly by delivery to the Swing Line Lender and the Administrative Agent of a written Swing Line
Loan Notice, appropriately completed and signed by a Responsible Officer of the Lead Borrower.
Promptly after receipt by the Swing Line Lender of any telephonic Swing Line Loan Notice, the Swing
Line Lender will confirm with the Administrative Agent (by telephone or in writing) that the
Administrative Agent has also received such Swing Line Loan Notice and, if not, the Swing Line
Lender will notify the Administrative Agent (by telephone or in writing) of the contents thereof.

make or maintain LIBO Rate Loans shall be suspended until the Administrative Agent (upon the
instruction of the Required Lenders) revokes such notice. Upon receipt of such notice, the Lead
Borrower may revoke any pending request for a Borrowing of, Conversion to or continuation of LIBO
Rate Loans or, failing that, will be deemed to have Converted such request into a request for a
