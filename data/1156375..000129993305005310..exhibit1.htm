<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">Section&nbsp;2.1 <U>Revolving Credit Loans</U>. Through and including the Revolving Credit
Termination Date, each Bank severally agrees, on the terms and conditions set forth in this
Agreement and in its Note, to make Loans to the Company from time to time in amounts not to exceed
in the aggregate at any one time outstanding the amount of its Commitment; provided, however, that
no Loan shall be made if, after giving effect thereto, the aggregate outstanding principal of all
Loans would exceed the lesser of (A)&nbsp;the Aggregate Commitment or (B)&nbsp;the Borrowing Base. Subject
to the terms of this Agreement, the Company may borrow, repay and reborrow at any time through the
Revolving Credit Termination Date. The obligations of any Bank to make Loans hereunder shall cease
at 4:01 p.m. (Chicago time) on the Revolving Credit Termination Date.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">Section&nbsp;2.2 <U>Ratable Loans</U>. Each Advance hereunder shall consist of Loans made from
the several Banks, ratably in proportion to the amounts of their respective Commitments on the date
of such Advance.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">Section&nbsp;2.4 <U>Reborrowing of Advances</U>. No Loans may be made hereunder to repay Advances
without the consent of all of the Banks.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">Section&nbsp;2.5 <U>Optional Principal Payments</U>. The Company may from time to time prepay,
without premium or penalty, all or a portion of any outstanding Advance, pro rata among the Banks,
in accordance with their respective shares of such Advance by giving notice of such prepayment by
10:00&nbsp;a.m. (Chicago time) on the date of such payment to each Bank. Repayment of principal
pursuant to this <U>Section&nbsp;2.5</U> shall be applied to prepay the outstanding Loans, pro rata,

<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">Section&nbsp;2.6 <U>Mandatory Principal Payments</U>. On any day on which the aggregate
outstanding principal of the Loans exceeds the Borrowing Base or the Aggregate Commitment, such

<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">Section&nbsp;2.7.1 <U>Adjustments by the Company</U>. The Company may permanently reduce the
Aggregate Commitment, in whole or in part ratably among the Banks, in proportion to the amounts of
their respective Commitments in integral multiples of $1,000,000, upon at least ten Business Days&#146;
written notice to the Banks, which shall specify the amount of any such reduction; provided,
however, that, subject to <U>Sections&nbsp;2.7.2</U>, <U>11.9(b)</U> and <U>11.9(c)</U>, the amount
of the Aggregate Commitment may not be reduced below the outstanding principal amount of the
Advance(s), and provided further that a reduction by the Company of the Aggregate Commitment to
zero shall terminate this Agreement as of the effective date of such reduction. All accrued and
unpaid commitment fees shall be payable on the effective date of such termination.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">Section&nbsp;2.7.2 <U>Adjustments by Banks for Accelerated Termination</U>. If the Commitment of
a Bank hereunder is terminated pursuant to <U>Section&nbsp;11.9(b)</U> or <U>11.9(c)</U>, the Company
shall immediately notify each remaining Bank (<B>&#147;Non-Terminating Bank&#148;</B>), in writing of such
termination (<B>&#147;Accelerated Termination Notice&#148;</B>) and shall state the amount of such terminating
Bank&#146;s Commitment (<B>&#147;Terminated Commitment&#148;</B>) in the Accelerated Termination Notice. Each
Non-Terminating Bank shall notify the Company, in writing, on or before the 5th Business Day after
the date of the Accelerated Termination Notice, if and by what amount such Bank is willing to
increase its Commitment, which amount shall be equal to all or some portion of the Terminated
Commitment (each, a <B>&#147;2.7.2 Notice&#148;</B>). Any Non-Terminating Bank that fails to so notify the Company
on or before such 5th Business Day, shall be deemed to have declined to increase its Commitment.
If offers to increase Commitments are made by two or more Non-Terminating Banks in an aggregate
amount greater than the aggregate amount of the Terminated Commitment, such Non-Terminating Banks
and the Company hereby agree that such offers shall be allocated as nearly as possible in
proportion to the aggregate amount of such offers, so that the aggregate amount thereof will not
exceed the amount of the Terminated Commitment. On or before the 6th Business Day after the date
of the Accelerated Termination Notice, the Company shall notify each Non-Terminating Bank of the
amount by which each such Non-Terminating Bank&#146;s Commitment has been increased, which amount shall
not exceed the amount of such Non-Terminating Bank&#146;s offer to increase its Commitment in such
Bank&#146;s 2.7.2 Notice. All increases of Commitments by the Banks, under this <U>Section&nbsp;2.7.2</U>
shall become effective on the terminating Bank&#146;s Accelerated Termination Date (<B>&#147;2.7.2 Effective
Date&#148;</B>). The Company shall promptly, and in no event later than the 2.7.2 Effective Date, deliver
to each Bank whose Commitment has been increased pursuant to this <U>Section&nbsp;2.7.2</U> a new Note
reflecting such Bank&#146;s new Commitment amount and each such Bank shall promptly, after repayment to
such Bank of such Bank&#146;s ratable share of all Advances outstanding on the 2.7.2 Effective Date,
return to the Company such Bank&#146;s superseded Note. On the 2.7.2 Effective Date, the Commitments
shall be adjusted to reflect any such increases.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">Section&nbsp;2.8 <U>Commitment Fee</U>. From the date hereof to and including the Revolving
Credit Termination Date, the Company agrees to pay to each Bank a commitment fee of 7/100 of 1% per
annum (on the basis of a year consisting of 360&nbsp;days and for actual days elapsed) on the daily
amount of such Bank&#146;s ratable share (determined in proportion to its respective Commitment) of the
excess of (i)&nbsp;the amount of the Aggregate Commitment over (ii)&nbsp;the aggregate principal amount of
all outstanding Advances of the Banks, payable in arrears on the last day of each November,
February, May and August hereafter and on the Revolving Credit Termination Date, commencing on the
first of such dates to occur after the date hereof.

Documents shall be secured by the Collateral in accordance with the Collateral Documents.

time replace any security credited to any Securities Account or any Money Fund Shares subject to
the Lien of the Security and Pledge Agreement with another security of a type described in CME Rule
816 or CME Rule&nbsp;821 that has a market value equal to or greater than the market value of the
replaced security, determined as of the date of replacement by the Collateral Agent in accordance

apply the proceeds thereof and any other amounts credited to any Securities Account to repay any
outstanding Loans, provided that after giving effect to such liquidation and the repayment of such
Loans, the aggregate principal amount of all remaining Loans outstanding as of the date of such
removal shall not exceed the Borrowing Base as of the date of such removal.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(a)&nbsp;The Company may, at its option and without the consent of the Banks, in a minimum amount
of $10,000,000 on each occasion, seek to increase the Aggregate Commitment by up to an aggregate
amount of $250,000,000 (resulting in a maximum Aggregate Commitment of $1,000,000,000) upon at
least three (3)&nbsp;Business Days&#146; prior written notice to the Collateral Agent, which notice shall
specify the amount of any such increase and shall be delivered at a time when no Default or
Unmatured Default has occurred and is continuing. The Company may, after giving such notice and in
its sole discretion, offer the increase in the Aggregate Commitment to other lenders or entities
reasonably acceptable to the Collateral Agent and the Company. No increase in the Aggregate
Commitment shall become effective until the existing or new Banks extending such new or increased
Commitment amount and the Company shall have delivered to the Collateral Agent a document
reasonably satisfactory to the Collateral Agent and the Company pursuant to which any such existing
Bank states the amount of its Commitment increase, any such new Bank states its Commitment amount
and agrees to assume and accept the obligations and rights of a Bank hereunder and the Company
accepts such new or increased Commitments. The Banks (new or existing) shall accept an assignment
from the existing Banks, and the existing Banks shall make an assignment to the new or existing
Banks accepting a new or increased Commitment, of a direct interest in each then outstanding
Advance such that, after giving effect thereto, all credit exposure hereunder is held ratably by
the Banks in proportion to their respective Commitments. Assignments pursuant to the preceding
sentence shall be made in exchange for the principal amount assigned plus accrued and unpaid
interest and accrued and unpaid facility fees. Any such increase of the Aggregate Commitment
shall be subject to receipt by the Collateral Agent from the Company of such supplemental opinions,
resolutions, certificates and other documents as the Collateral Agent may reasonably request.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(b)&nbsp;In addition to the foregoing, to the extent that the Company has reduced the Aggregate
Commitment with respect to any or all of the Banks, the Company may, from time to time, increase
any portion of any such Bank&#146;s respective Commitment, with such Bank&#146;s consent, in an amount up to
the amount so reduced, provided that each such Bank shall accept an assignment from the existing
Banks, and the existing Banks shall make an assignment to each such Bank of a direct interest in
each then outstanding Advance such that, after giving effect thereto, all credit exposure hereunder
is held ratably by the Banks in proportion to their respective Commitments. The documents
evidencing any such increase in the Commitment shall be in a form reasonably acceptable to the
Company and the Collateral Agent.

of each Advance, specifying the amount of such Advance, each Bank&#146;s pro rata share thereof and the
account located at the Collateral Agent to which the proceeds of such Advance are to be disbursed.
Subject to satisfaction of the applicable conditions precedent set forth in Article&nbsp;V, not later
than 4:45 p.m. (Chicago time) on each Borrowing Date, each Bank severally shall make available to
the Company in the specified account located at the Collateral Agent, its pro rata share of the
full amount of each Advance in immediately available funds. Further, if applicable, not later than
4:45 p.m. (Chicago time) on each Borrowing Date, each Servicing Bank shall make available to the
Company in the specified account located at the Collateral Agent, on behalf of the Bank or Banks
that it services, such serviced Bank&#146;s or Banks&#146; pro rata share of the full amount of each Advance
in immediately available funds. Following such notice of Advance from the Company, the Collateral
Agent shall determine the aggregate market value of the Collateral and the Borrowing Base in
accordance with the terms hereof and promptly, but in any event, not later than 4:15 p.m. (Chicago
time), provide the Company and each Bank with a Collateral Notice. Upon determination of the
Borrowing Base, the Collateral Agent shall make available to the Company in immediately available
funds the lesser of (a)&nbsp;the aggregate amount of each Bank&#146;s pro rata share of the Advance to the
extent such amount has been funded by such Bank at such time or (b)&nbsp;the Excess Availability.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">Section&nbsp;3.2 <U>Minimum Amount of Each Advance</U>. Except in the case of a Test Draw, each
Advance shall be in the minimum amount of $10,000,000 (and in integral multiples of $250,000 if in
excess thereof), provided, however, that any Advance may be in the aggregate amount of the Excess

maturity, whether by acceleration or otherwise, shall bear interest until paid in full at a rate
per annum equal to the Fed Funds Effective Rate plus 2.4% per annum. In the event that a change in
the Fed Funds Effective Rate is announced or published at the time a Loan is outstanding, such
change shall become effective at the time it is announced or published.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">Section&nbsp;3.4 <U>Method of Payment</U>. All payments (including prepayments) of principal,
interest, commitment fees and other amounts payable hereunder by the Company shall be made without
setoff or counterclaim in immediately available funds to the Banks (or, if applicable, the related
Servicing Banks) at the addresses specified pursuant to Article&nbsp;XIII. All such payments shall be

following order: first, to amounts payable hereunder other than principal, interest and commitment
fees; second, to commitment fees (in chronological order in accordance with the dates such fees
became due and payable); and third, to principal of, and interest on, the Advances (in
chronological order in accordance with the dates such Advances were made; and as to any single
Advance, first to interest thereon and second to principal thereof). Subject to the provisions of
<U>Section&nbsp;4.4</U> and, except with respect to payments made to a Bank whose Commitment is
terminated (or whose commitment fee is revised) pursuant to <U>Section&nbsp;11.9(b)</U> or <U>(c)</U>,
(a)&nbsp;all payments of principal of, and interest on, the Advances shall be made to the Banks (or, if
applicable, the related Servicing Banks) ratably among the Banks, in proportion to the outstanding
principal amount of their respective Loans constituting part of such Advance and (b)&nbsp;all payments
of commitment fees and other amounts payable hereunder to the Banks shall be made to the Banks (or,
if applicable, the related Servicing Banks on behalf of the applicable Banks, if applicable)
ratably among the Banks, in proportion to the amounts of their respective Commitments on the date
such payment is made.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">Section&nbsp;3.5 <U>Notes; Telephonic Notices</U>. Each Bank shall maintain in accordance with
its usual and customary practices an account or accounts evidencing the Loans made by such Bank
from time to time, including the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to such Bank
from time to time under this Agreement and the Notes; and each Bank is hereby authorized to record
the principal amount of each of its Loans and each repayment on the schedule attached to its Note
or in its books and records; provided, however, that the failure to so record shall not affect the
Company&#146;s obligations under such Note. The records kept by each Bank shall be presumed to be
accurate and shall be binding upon the Company absent manifest error. The Company hereby authorizes
the Banks and the Servicing Banks to extend Advances based on telephonic notices made by any
Persons any such Bank or Servicing Bank in good faith believes to be acting on behalf of the
Company. The Company agrees to deliver promptly to each Bank and Servicing Bank a written
confirmation of each telephonic notice signed by an authorized signatory. If the written
confirmation differs in any material respect from the action taken by a Bank or Servicing Bank, as
applicable, the records of such Bank or Servicing Bank, as applicable, shall govern absent manifest
error.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">Section&nbsp;3.6 <U>Interest Payment Dates; Interest Basis</U>. Interest accrued on each Advance
prior to maturity shall be payable to the Banks (or, if applicable, the related Servicing Banks) on
the date on which the Advance is paid or prepaid, whether due to acceleration or otherwise.
Interest accrued on each Advance after maturity shall be payable on demand. Interest and
commitment fees shall be calculated for actual days elapsed on the basis of a 360-day year.
Interest shall be payable for the day an Advance is made but not for the day of any payment on the
amount paid if payment is received prior to noon (local time at the place of payment). If any
payment of principal of, or interest on, an Advance shall become due on a day which is not a
Business Day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day and, in the case of a
principal payment, such extension of time shall be included in computing interest in connection
with such payment.

the Company of each Advance requested pursuant to <U>Section&nbsp;3.1</U>, the Servicing Banks shall
notify each of the applicable Banks by telephone (which may, at the option of the Servicing Banks,
be accompanied by facsimile transmission), of each Advance, which notice shall state: (a)&nbsp;the
dollar amount of such Advance; (b)&nbsp;each Bank&#146;s ratable share of such Advance; (c)&nbsp;the date and time
when such Advance is to be made; and (d)&nbsp;the Servicing Bank to which the applicable Bank&#146;s ratable
share of such Advance shall be sent. Except as hereinafter provided, promptly after receipt of
such notice from the applicable Servicing Bank and, in any event, before the time specified in such
notice as the time when such Advance is to be made to the Company, each applicable Bank shall
transfer its ratable share of such Advance to the appropriate Servicing Bank by Federal Reserve
wire transfer or, in the event of a failure of the Federal Reserve wire transfer system, in other
immediately available funds via the SWIFT system or otherwise.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">Section&nbsp;4.2 <U>Payment by Banks to Servicing Banks</U>. If a Servicing Bank fails to receive
a transfer from any of the applicable Banks by the time required pursuant to <U>Section&nbsp;4.1</U>,
such Servicing Bank shall advance such amount for and on behalf of such Bank, provided that,
notwithstanding the foregoing, such Bank shall, in any event, transfer to the Servicing Bank, by
the means set forth in <U>Section&nbsp;4.1</U>, its ratable share of the relevant Advance not later
than 10:00&nbsp;a.m. (Chicago time) the next Business Day after the Servicing Bank provides such Bank
with the notice specified in <U>Section&nbsp;4.1</U>. In the event a Servicing Bank advances funds
overnight to the Company pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence, the Bank on whose behalf
such funds are advanced shall reimburse the Servicing Bank for the Servicing Bank&#146;s cost of
overnight funds, for the period from the time the Servicing Bank advances such funds to the Company
for and on behalf of such Bank to the time of the Servicing Bank&#146;s receipt of such Bank&#146;s transfer
of its ratable share of the relevant Advance. Such Servicing Bank shall promptly provide such Bank
with notice of the amount of its cost of overnight funds for such period and such amount shall
thereupon become immediately due and payable from such Bank to such Servicing Bank, and shall be
paid by such Bank to such Servicing Bank upon receipt of such notice without further notice from or
demand by such Servicing Bank.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">Section&nbsp;4.3 <U>Distribution of Payments</U>. Whenever a Servicing Bank receives from, or on
behalf of the Company, or any other person or party, a payment of principal, interest or commitment
fees or other amount payable in connection with the Loans with respect to any of which the
applicable Banks are entitled to receive a share, such Servicing Bank shall promptly pay to such
Banks, in lawful money of the United States of America and in the kind of funds so received by such
Servicing Bank, the amount due each of such Banks as determined pursuant to this Agreement;
provided, however, that the amount of such distribution shall be adjusted to the extent that
amounts are owed by any Bank to such Servicing Bank pursuant to <U>Section&nbsp;4.2</U> or are required
to be returned to such Servicing Bank pursuant to <U>Section&nbsp;4.4</U>. If any payment of
principal, interest or commitment fees or other amount payable in connection with the Loans is
received from or on behalf of the Company by a Servicing Bank before 10:00&nbsp;a.m. (Chicago time) on
any Business Day, that Servicing Bank shall use reasonable efforts to wire transfer the appropriate
portion of the same to the applicable Banks that same Business Day, but in any event shall wire the
same to each of such Banks before the end of the next Business Day. In the event that a Servicing
Bank receives any such payment from or on behalf of the Company before 10:00&nbsp;a.m. (Chicago time) on
any Business Day and does not transfer to the applicable Banks the appropriate portion of such
payment on that day, the Company shall, promptly upon receipt of notice from any such Bank, pay
directly to such Bank an amount equal to the interest on such portion, at the Fed Funds Effective
Rate or, with respect to any payment of principal on a Loan, at the rate set forth in <U>Section
3.3</U>, for the period commencing on the day such Servicing Bank receives such payment up to but
not including the following Business Day.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">Section&nbsp;4.4 <U>Rescission of Payments by the Company</U>. If all or part of any payment made
by the Company to a Servicing Bank of principal, interest or commitment fees or other amount
payable in connection with the Loans is rescinded or must otherwise be returned for any reason and
if a Servicing Bank has paid to any of the Banks such Bank&#146;s ratable share therein, such Bank
shall, upon telephone notice from such Servicing Bank, forthwith pay to such Servicing Bank, on the
date of such telephone notice (if notice is received by such Servicing Bank at or prior to 10:00
a.m. Chicago time) or on the next Business Day (if notice is received by such Servicing Bank after
10:00&nbsp;a.m. Chicago time), an amount equal to such Bank&#146;s ratable interest in the amount that was
rescinded or that must be so returned by the Servicing Bank. A Servicing Bank shall promptly
return to the Company each such amount (or any lesser amount) that is received from each Bank. A
Servicing Bank shall have no obligation to the Company for any amount that the Servicing Bank paid
to any Bank and that is not repaid by such Bank, provided that the Servicing Bank did in fact
provide such Bank with the notice described above to the effect that such payment was rescinded or
must be returned.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">Section&nbsp;4.5 <U>Powers Granted to the Servicing Banks</U>. The Company and one or more Banks
(each a <B>&#147;Principal Bank&#148;</B>) may, upon mutual agreement, from time to time request another Bank to act
as a Servicing Bank for the purpose of administering and servicing the Loans of the Principal
Banks. Upon the acceptance of the offer to service by the proposed Servicing Bank (which shall be
in the sole discretion of such proposed Servicing Bank), such Bank shall be a Servicing Bank
hereunder and as administrator of the Loans of the Principal Banks for which it acts (and not as an
agent, employee or fiduciary), shall be entitled to exercise all such powers as are incidental to
the powers to receive and collect funds from the Principal Banks and the Company as provided for in
this Agreement, and to take such other actions with respect to such Loans as are provided hereby or
as may be from time to time agreed by such Servicing Bank and the Principal Banks. In acting under
this Agreement, each Servicing Bank agrees to exercise the same degree of care in administering
such Loans as it would use in managing its own loans; provided, however, that this sentence shall
not make any Servicing Bank a fiduciary to any Principal Bank. The Principal Banks and the Company
hereby agree and acknowledge that (i)&nbsp;in performing the duties provided for in this Agreement, the
Servicing Banks are acting solely for the benefit of the Principal Banks and are in no way to be
construed to be acting as agent for the Company; and (ii)&nbsp;the servicing arrangement provided for
herein is not intended to constitute, and shall not be construed to establish, a partnership or
joint venture between the Servicing Banks and the Principal Banks, or between the Servicing Banks
and the Company.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">Section&nbsp;4.6 <U>Resignation or Termination of Servicing Bank</U>. A Servicing Bank may resign
its position as such at any time upon thirty (30)&nbsp;day&#146;s prior written notice to the Company and the
Principal Banks for which it acts, and the Company and the applicable Principal Banks acting
together may terminate a Servicing Bank&#146;s role as such at any time upon thirty (30)&nbsp;day&#146;s prior
written notice to such Servicing Bank. Subsequent to the effective date of such resignation or
termination, the resigned or terminated (as applicable) Servicing Bank shall have no further
obligations in that capacity under this Agreement, and unless and until a successor servicing bank
is appointed by the Company and the applicable Principal Banks acting together, (i)&nbsp;the services
performed by such Servicing Bank hereunder shall be performed by the individual Principal Banks and
the Company, each on its own behalf, and (ii)&nbsp;any payments or communications made by the Company to
such Servicing Bank hereunder shall be made directly to the applicable individual Principal Banks.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">Section&nbsp;4.7 <U>Non-Reliance Representation</U>. Each of the Banks acknowledges and
represents that it has, independently of and without reliance upon the Servicing Banks, and based
solely upon its own expertise (and the expertise of its agents and independent advisors, if any)
and upon financial statements and other information deemed appropriate by it, made its own credit
analysis of the Company and made its own decision to enter into this Agreement. Each of the Banks
further acknowledges and represents that it will, independently of and without reliance upon the
Servicing Banks, and based solely upon its own expertise (and the expertise of its agents and
independent advisors, if any) and upon such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate
at the time, continue to make its own credit analysis of the Company and its own decisions with
respect to this Agreement.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">Section&nbsp;4.8 <U>Exculpation</U>. No Servicing Bank nor any of its shareholders, directors,
officers, employees or agents shall be liable to the Banks, or any of them individually, for any
obligation, undertaking, act or judgment of the Company or any other Person, or for any error of
judgment or any action taken or omitted to be taken by such Servicing Banks or any other Servicing
Bank (except and to the extent that the same arises from gross negligence or willful misconduct on
the part of such Servicing Bank), or be bound to ascertain or inquire as to the performance or
observance of any term of any of the Loan Documents. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the Servicing Banks: (a)&nbsp;may consult with legal counsel selected by the Servicing Banks
and shall not be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken in good faith by the Servicing
Banks in accordance with the advice of such counsel; (b)&nbsp;makes no warranty or representation and
shall not be responsible for any warranty or representation made in or in connection with any of
the Loan Documents, or for the financial condition of the Company or any other Person, or for the
observance or performance of any obligations of the Company or any other Person, or for the truth
or accuracy of any document provided to the Banks that the Servicing Banks have initially received
from, or that the Servicing Banks have prepared based upon information received from, the Company
or any other Person; (c)&nbsp;make no warranty or representation and shall not be responsible for the
due execution, validity, enforceability, sufficiency or collectibility of any of the Loan
Documents; (d)&nbsp;shall incur no liability under or in respect of any such agreement or document by
acting upon any notice (by telephone or otherwise), or writing (including telex and telegraphic
communication) believed by the Servicing Banks in good faith to be genuine and to be signed or sent
by the proper party or Person; and (e)&nbsp;make no warranty or guarantee as to: (i)&nbsp;future payments by
the Company or any other obligor or guarantor of the Loans, (ii)&nbsp;the Company&#146;s future compliance
with or performance of any of the terms and conditions contained in the Loan Documents, or (iii)
the collectibility of the Loans.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">The Company represents and warrants to the Banks, as of the date hereof and the date of each
Advance, that:


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">Section&nbsp;6.1 <U>Corporate Existence and Standing</U>. Each of the Company and the
Subsidiaries is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the

the Loan Documents and to perform its obligations thereunder. The execution and delivery by the
Company of the Loan Documents and the performance of its obligations thereunder have been duly
authorized by proper corporate proceedings. The Company has duly executed and delivered the Loan

enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms, except as enforceability may be
limited by bankruptcy, insolvency or similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors&#146; rights

instrument or agreement to which the Company or any Subsidiary is a party or is subject, or by
which it, or its property, is bound, or conflict with or constitute a default thereunder. No
order, consent, approval, license, authorization, or validation of, or filing, recording or
registration with, or exemption by, any governmental or public body or authority, or any
subdivision thereof, that has not been obtained is required to authorize, or is required in
connection with the execution, delivery and performance of, or the legality, validity, binding
effect or enforceability of, any of the Loan Documents as against the Company.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">Section&nbsp;6.4 <U>Financial Statements</U>. The most recent annual, audited consolidated

Subsidiaries) heretofore delivered to the Banks were prepared in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles in effect on the date such statements were prepared and fairly present in all
material respects the consolidated financial condition and operations of Holdings and its

since the date of the financial statements referred to in <U>Section&nbsp;6.4</U>; provided, however,
that in the event the Company utilizes its own funds to repay all or any portion of an Advance, and
such repayment results in such a material adverse change, then such material adverse change shall
not be deemed to have occurred until the thirty-first consecutive day that such material adverse
change continues.

been duly authorized and issued and are fully paid and non-assessable.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">Section&nbsp;6.7 <U>Accuracy of Information</U>. No written information, exhibit or report

less than 25% of those assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries which are subject to any
limitation on sale, pledge, or other restriction hereunder. No proceeds of any Loans will be used
to &#147;purchase&#148; or &#147;carry&#148; any &#147;margin stock&#148; (each as defined in Regulation&nbsp;U), or for any purpose
that violates the provisions of Regulation&nbsp;T, U or X of the Board of Governors of the Federal

federal tax returns and all other material tax returns which are required to be filed by any of
them and have paid all taxes due pursuant to said returns or pursuant to any assessment received by
the Company or any such Subsidiary, except such taxes, if any, as are being contested in good
faith. To the best of the Company&#146;s knowledge, no tax liens have been filed and no claims are
being asserted with respect to any such taxes other than those taxes that are being contested in
good faith. The charges, accruals and reserves on the books of the Company and its Subsidiaries in
respect of any taxes or other governmental charges are adequate.

or results of operations of the Company or the ability of the Company to perform its obligations
under the Loan Documents.

requirements of law and regulations, no Reportable Event has occurred with respect to any Plan,
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has withdrawn from any Plan or initiated steps to

time reasonably request.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">Section&nbsp;7.2 <U>Use of Proceeds</U>. Except in the case of a Test Draw, the Company will only
use the proceeds of the Advances to provide temporary liquidity in circumstances where CME is
entitled to use the Security Deposits and Performance Bonds of its Clearing Members to satisfy any
outstanding obligations of any defaulting Clearing Members to CME as provided in the CME Rules and
in circumstances where a Money Gridlock Situation that affects the Company&#146;s operations exists.
Additionally, the Company may use the proceeds of the Advances to fulfill its obligations under the
GFX&#153; Guaranty, provided, however, that the Company may use the proceeds for such purposes only up
to the amount of Surplus Funds on any given day. Additionally, the Company from time to time may
conduct Test Draws which may be repaid on the Borrowing Date or on the Business Day immediately
following such Borrowing Date. The Company will not, nor will it permit any Subsidiary to, use any
of the proceeds of the Loans to &#147;purchase&#148; or &#147;carry&#148; any &#147;margin stock&#148; (each as defined in
Regulation&nbsp;U) or for any purpose that violates the provisions of Regulation&nbsp;T, U or X of the Board
of the Federal Reserve System as now and from time to time hereafter in effect.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">Section&nbsp;7.3 <U>Notice of Default</U>. The Company will, and will cause each Subsidiary to,

materially adversely affect its business, properties or affairs or the ability of the Company to
repay the Obligations.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">Section&nbsp;7.4 <U>Conduct of Business</U>. The Company will, and will cause each Subsidiary to,
carry on and conduct its business in substantially the same manner and in substantially the same
fields of enterprise as it is presently conducted and to do all things necessary to remain duly
incorporated, validly existing and in good standing as a domestic corporation in its jurisdiction
of incorporation and maintain all requisite authority to conduct its business in each jurisdiction
in which its business is conducted and where the failure to have such authority would reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">Section&nbsp;7.5 <U>Compliance with Laws</U>. The Company will, and will cause each Subsidiary
to, comply with all laws, rules, regulations, orders, writs, judgments, injunctions, decrees or
awards to which it may be subject, except where the failure to so comply would not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">Section&nbsp;7.6 <U>Inspection</U>. The Company will, and will cause each Subsidiary to, permit
the Collateral Agent or its representatives and agents, to inspect any of the properties, corporate
books and financial records of the Company and each Subsidiary, to examine and make copies of the

the affairs, finances and accounts of the Company and each Subsidiary (the foregoing activities, an
<B>&#147;Audit&#148;</B>) with, and to be advised as to the same by, their respective officers at such reasonable
times and intervals as the Collateral Agent may designate; provided that so long as no Default has
occurred and is continuing the Company shall only be responsible for the costs and expenses of one
Audit per 12-month period.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">Section&nbsp;7.7 <U>Tangible Net Worth</U>. The Company will maintain at all times a Consolidated
Tangible Net Worth of not less than $90,000,000. In the event that the Company exercises its right
to increase the Aggregate Commitment under Section&nbsp;2.10(a), the minimum Consolidated Tangible Net
Worth that the Company will maintain will increase on a ratable basis to the increase in the
Aggregate Commitment such that if the Company increases the Aggregate Commitment by $250,000,000
(resulting in a maximum Aggregate Commitment of $1,000,000,000), the minimum Consolidated Tangible
Net Worth to be maintained by the Company would increase by $30,000,000 to $120,000,000. If the
Company exercises its rights to decrease the Aggregate Commitment under this Agreement, the minimum
Consolidated Tangible Net Worth to be maintained by the Company will decrease on a ratable basis,
provided, however, that under no circumstances will the minimum Consolidated Tangible Net Worth be
reduced to less than $90,000,000. Any such ratable increase or decrease in the Company&#146;s
maintenance of the Consolidated Tangible Net Worth shall be effective immediately upon the related
increase or decrease in the Aggregate Commitment in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

fully justified in failing or refusing to take any action under this Agreement or any other Loan
Document unless it shall first receive such advice or concurrence of the Company or the Required
Banks (or, if required, all of the Banks), as applicable, as it deems appropriate and it shall
first be indemnified to its satisfaction by the Banks, provided that unless and until the
Collateral Agent shall have received such advice, the Collateral Agent may take or refrain from
taking any action, as the Collateral Agent shall deem advisable and in the best interests of the
Banks. The Collateral Agent shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from
acting, in accordance with a request of the Company or the Required Banks or all of the Banks, as
applicable, and such request and any action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be
binding upon all the Banks.

hereunder or under any other Loan Document and (ii)&nbsp;for any other actual out-of-pocket expenses
incurred by the Collateral Agent, in its capacity as Collateral Agent and acting on behalf of the

negligence or willful misconduct of the Collateral Agent.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">Section&nbsp;10.4 <U>Collateral Agent in its Individual Capacity</U>. The Collateral Agent and
its affiliates may make loans to, accept deposits from and generally engage in any kind of business
with the Company or any affiliate of the Company as though the Collateral Agent were not the
Collateral Agent hereunder. With respect to the making of Loans pursuant to this Agreement, the
Collateral Agent shall have the same rights and powers under this Agreement in its individual
capacity as any Bank and may exercise the same as though it were not the Collateral Agent, and the
terms <B>&#147;Bank,&#148; </B>and <B>&#147;Banks&#148; </B>shall include the Collateral Agent in its individual capacity.

resign its position as such at any time upon ninety (90)&nbsp;days&#146; prior notice to the Company and the
Banks. The Collateral Agent may be terminated by 100% of the Banks (excluding any Bank then acting
as Collateral Agent) at any time upon thirty (30)&nbsp;days&#146; prior notice to the Company, the Collateral
Agent and the other Banks. The Required Banks, with the consent of the Company (such consent not
to be unreasonably withheld), shall appoint a successor Collateral Agent to succeed any Collateral
Agent that resigns or is terminated pursuant to this <U>Section&nbsp;10.5</U>. Subsequent to the
effective date of such resignation or termination, the resigning or terminated (as applicable)
Collateral Agent shall have no further obligations in that capacity under this Agreement. If no
successor Collateral Agent shall have been appointed by the Company and the Required Banks and
shall have accepted such appointment prior to the effective date of the resignation or termination
of the then acting Collateral Agent, the resigning or terminated Collateral Agent may appoint a
successor Collateral Agent, which shall be a bank or trust company organized under the laws of the

analysis of the Company and made its own decision to enter into this Agreement. Each of the Banks
further acknowledges and represents that it will, independently of and without reliance upon the
Collateral Agent, and based solely upon its own expertise (and the expertise of its agents and
independent advisors, if any) and upon such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate
at the time, continue to make its own credit analysis of the Company and its own decisions with
respect to this Agreement.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">Section&nbsp;10.7 <U>Exculpation</U>. Neither the Collateral Agent nor any of its shareholders,
directors, officers, employees or agents shall be liable to the Banks, or any of them individually,
for any obligation, undertaking, act or judgment of the Company or any other Person, or for any
error of judgment or any action taken or omitted to be taken by the Collateral Agent (except and to
the extent that the same arises from gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the
Collateral Agent), or be bound to ascertain or inquire as to the performance or observance of any
term of any of the Loan Documents. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
Collateral Agent: (a)&nbsp;may consult with legal counsel selected by it and shall not be liable for any
action taken or omitted to be taken in good faith by it in accordance with the advice of such
counsel; (b)&nbsp;makes no warranty or representation and shall not be responsible for any warranty or
representation made in or in connection with any of the Loan Documents by any Person other than the

indemnified by the Company, or with respect to which the Company has paid Additional Amounts
pursuant hereto, it shall promptly notify the Company of the availability of such refund claim and,
if such Bank determines in good faith that making a claim for refund will not have a material
adverse effect on its taxes or business operations, shall, within 30&nbsp;days after receipt of a
request by the Company, make a claim to such governmental authority for such refund at the
Company&#146;s expense. If a Bank receives a refund in respect of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes

are a precondition to obtaining the benefit of such reduced rate or exemption, provided that the

applicable law or reasonably requested by the Company as will permit such payments to be made
without withholding or at a reduced rate, unless in the good faith opinion of the Foreign Bank such
documentation would expose the Foreign Bank to any material adverse consequences or risk. Such
documentation shall be delivered by each Foreign Bank on or before the date it becomes a Bank and
on or before the date, if any, such Foreign Bank changes its applicable lending office by
designating a different lending office with respect to its Loans (a <B>&#147;New Lending Office&#148;</B>). In
addition, each Foreign Bank shall deliver such forms promptly upon the obsolescence or invalidity
of any form previously delivered by such Foreign Bank. Each Bank (and, in the case of a Foreign
Bank, its lending office), represents that on the date hereof, payments made hereunder by the

New Lending Office; (C)&nbsp;with respect to a change by such Foreign Bank of the jurisdiction in which
it is organized, incorporated, controlled or managed, or in which it is doing business, from the

jurisdiction in which it is organized, incorporated, controlled or managed, or in which it is doing
business; or (D)&nbsp;to the extent that the obligation to pay such indemnity payment or Additional

interest thereon, accrued and unpaid fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder from the
assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Company

the Company to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply.

thereof and methodology in calculating, each in reasonable detail) claimed under this <U>Section
