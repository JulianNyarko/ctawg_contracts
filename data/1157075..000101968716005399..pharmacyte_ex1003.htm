program arrangement that may be made available by the Company; or (iii) by any combination of the foregoing. For this purpose,
&ldquo;<U>Fair Market Value</U>&rdquo; means, as of any relevant date, the value of the Company&rsquo;s Shares determined as follows:
(a) if the Shares are admitted to trading on a &ldquo;national securities exchange&rdquo; (as defined under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended) on such date, the closing price per Share on such date on the principal national securities exchange on
which the Shares are traded or, if no Shares are traded on that date, the closing price per Share on the next preceding date on
which Shares are traded; (b) if the Shares are not admitted to trading on a national securities exchange on such date but are traded
on the electronic quotation system operated by OTC Markets Group, Inc. (&ldquo;OTCQB&rdquo;), the last closing price for a Share
as reported by the OTCQB (or similar organization or agency succeeding to its functions of reporting prices) at the close of business
on such date, or if there is no closing price on such date, then the closing bid price on such date; or (c) if the Shares are not
listed on a national securities exchange or traded on the OTCQB or other service, the fair market value per Share as determined
by the Board, acting in its discretion in accordance with the requirements of applicable tax law.</P>

distribution in Shares to holders of its outstanding Shares; (ii) subdivide its outstanding Shares into a greater number of Shares;
(iii) combine its outstanding Shares into a smaller number of Shares; or (iv) issue any Shares in a reclassification of the Shares,
then the number of Shares purchasable upon exercise of this Option immediately prior thereto shall be adjusted so that the Participant
shall be entitled to receive the kind and number of Shares or other securities which it would have owned or have been entitled
to receive had such Option been exercised in advance thereof. Upon each such adjustment of the kind and number of Shares or other
securities of the Company which are purchasable hereunder, the Participant shall thereafter be entitled to purchase the number
of Shares or other securities resulting from such adjustment at an Exercise Price per Share or other security obtained by multiplying
the Exercise Price in effect immediately prior to such adjustment by the number of Shares purchasable pursuant hereto immediately
prior to such adjustment and dividing by the number of Shares or other securities of the Company that are purchasable pursuant
hereto immediately thereafter. An adjustment made pursuant to this paragraph shall become effective immediately after the effective
date of such event retroactive to the record date, if any, for such event.</P>

its capital stock, consolidate or merge with or into another corporation (where the Company is not the surviving corporation or
where there is a change in or distribution with respect to the Shares of the Company), or sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of
any of its property, assets or business to another corporation and, pursuant to the terms of such reorganization, reclassification,

shares of stock or other securities or property of any nature whatsoever (including warrants or other subscription or purchase
rights) in addition to or in lieu of common stock of the successor or acquiring corporation (&ldquo;<U>Other Property</U>&rdquo;),
are to be received by or distributed to the holders of the Company, then the Participant shall have the right thereafter to receive,
upon exercise of this Option, the number of shares of common stock of the successor or acquiring corporation or of the Company&rsquo;s
Shares, if it is the surviving corporation, and Other Property receivable upon or as a result of such reorganization, reclassification,
merger, consolidation or disposition of assets by the Participant of the number of Shares of for which this Option is exercisable
immediately prior to such event. In case of any such reorganization, reclassification, merger, consolidation or disposition of
assets, the successor or acquiring corporation (if other than the Company) shall expressly assume the due and punctual observance
and performance of each and every covenant and condition of this Option to be performed and observed by the Company and all the
obligations and liabilities hereunder, subject to such modifications as may be deemed appropriate (as determined in good faith
by resolution of the Board of the Company) in order to provide for adjustments of Shares for which this Option is exercisable which
shall be as nearly equivalent as practicable to the adjustments provided for in this Section 7 of this Option. For purposes of
this Section 7(b), &ldquo;common stock of the successor or acquiring corporation&rdquo; shall include stock of such corporation
of any class which is not preferred as to dividends or assets over any other class of stock of such corporation and which is not
subject to redemption and shall also include any evidences of indebtedness, shares of stock or other securities which are convertible
into or exchangeable for any such stock, either immediately or upon the arrival of a specified date or the happening of a specified
event and any warrants or other rights to subscribe for or purchase any such stock. The foregoing provisions of this Section 7
shall similarly apply to successive reorganizations, reclassifications, mergers, consolidations or disposition of assets.</P>

record date for the determination of holders entitled to receive a dividend or other distribution payable in: (i) cash; (ii)
any evidences of indebtedness, or any other securities of the Company or any property of any nature whatsoever, other than,
in each case, Shares; or (iii) any warrants or other rights to subscribe for or purchase any evidences of indebtedness, or
any other securities of the Company or any property of any nature whatsoever, other than, in each case, Shares, then, and in
each event, (A) the number of Shares for which this Option shall be exercisable shall be adjusted to equal the product of the
number of Shares for which this Option is exercisable immediately prior to such adjustment multiplied by a traction (1) the
numerator of which shall be the Fair Market Value of the Shares at the date of taking such record and (2) the denominator of
which shall be such Fair Market Value of the Shares minus the amount allocable to one Share of any such cash so distributable
and of the fair value (as determined in good faith by the Board) of any and all such evidences of indebtedness, Shares, other
securities or property or warrants or other subscription or purchase rights so distributable, and (B) the Exercise Price then
in effect shall be adjusted to equal (1) the Exercise Price then in effect multiplied by the number of Shares for which this
Option is exercisable immediately prior to the adjustment divided by (2) the number of Shares for which this Option is
exercisable immediately after such adjustment. A rectification of the Shares (other than a change in par value, or from par
value to no par value or from no par value to par value) into Shares and shares of any other class of stock shall be deemed a
distribution by the Company to the holders of such Shares of such other class of shares within the meaning of this Section
7(c) and, if the outstanding Shares shall be changed into a larger or smaller number of Shares as a part of such
reclassification, such change shall be deemed a subdivision or combination, as the case may be, of the outstanding Shares
within the meaning of Section 7(a).</P>
