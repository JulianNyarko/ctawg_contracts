parties hereto to be a complete and exclusive statement of the agreement and understanding of the parties in respect of the subject matter contained herein and supersedes all prior agreements and undertakings among the parties with respect to such
subject matter. No party hereto shall have any rights, duties or obligations other than those specifically set forth in this Agreement. </P>

such party for the other party&#146;s failure to perform their obligations under this Agreement, the parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the remedy at law for any failure to perform their obligations hereunder would be inadequate and that each
of them, respectively, to the extent permitted by applicable law, shall be entitled to specific performance, injunctive relief or other equitable remedies in the event of any such failure, without bond or other security being required. </P>

circumstances, is held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect for any reason, the parties shall negotiate in good faith with a view to the substitution therefor of a suitable and equitable solution in order to carry out, so far as may be
valid and enforceable, the intent and purpose of such invalid provision, provided, however, that the validity, legality and enforceability of any such provision in every other respect and of the remaining provisions contained herein shall not be in
any way impaired thereby, it being intended that all of the rights and privileges of the parties hereto shall be enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by law. </P>
