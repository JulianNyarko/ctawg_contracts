additional retirement income from the Exchange. The Plan was originally effective on January&nbsp;1, 1993 (the &#147;Effective Date&#148;) and has been subsequently amended from time to time. The Plan is intended to constitute a plan maintained
primarily for the purpose of providing deferred compensation for a select group of management or highly compensated employees within the meaning of Sections 201(2), 301(a)(3), and 401(a)(1) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as
