NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTOR<BR>
RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AGREEMENT</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THIS RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AGREEMENT (together with the attached grant notice (the &#147;<B>Grant
Notice</B>&#148;), (the &#147;<B>Agreement</B>&#148;) is made and entered into as of the date set forth on the Grant Notice
by and between Big 5 Sporting Goods Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the &#147;<B>Company</B>&#148;), and the
individual (the &#147;<B>Grantee</B>&#148;) set forth on the Grant Notice.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A.&nbsp;Pursuant to the Big 5 Sporting Goods Corporation 2007 Equity and Performance Incentive Plan
(the &#147;<B>Plan</B>&#148;), the Committee has determined that it is to the advantage and best interest of the
Company to grant to Grantee the number of Restricted Stock Units (as defined below) of the Company
(the &#147;<B>Units</B>&#148;) set forth on the Grant Notice, and in all respects subject to the terms, definitions
and provisions of this Agreement and the Plan, which is incorporated herein by reference.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B.&nbsp;Unless otherwise defined herein, capitalized terms used in this Agreement shall have the
meanings set forth in the Plan.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual agreements contained herein, the Grantee and
the Company hereby agree as follows:
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.&nbsp;<U>Grant and Terms of Units</U>.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.1 <U>Grant of Units</U>. Pursuant to the Grant Notice, the Company has granted to the
Grantee, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Plan and this Agreement, the number
of Restricted Stock Units set forth on the Grant Notice. &#147;<B>Restricted Stock Units</B>&#148; shall mean units
granted pursuant to Article&nbsp;VIII of the Plan, pursuant to which the Company has agreed to issue
shares of Common Stock to Grantee subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Plan and
this Agreement (including the vesting and payment provisions of this Section&nbsp;1).
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.2 <U>Account</U>. Each Unit and Additional Unit (as defined below) shall be recorded in an
account (the &#147;<B>Account</B>&#148;), which shall specify whether such Unit and Additional Unit is vested or
nonvested and which shall be maintained on the books and records of the Company.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.3 <U>Cash Dividends</U>. Whenever any cash dividends are declared on the Common Stock, the
Company will credit the Account on the date such dividend is paid with a number of additional
Restricted Stock Units (the &#147;<B>Additional Units</B>&#148;) equal to the result of dividing (i)&nbsp;the product of
(x)&nbsp;the total number of Units and Additional Units credited to the Account on the record date for
such dividend (without taking into consideration the Additional Units credited to the Account as a
result of such dividend) and (y)&nbsp;the per share amount of such dividend by (ii)&nbsp;the Fair Market
Value of one share of Common Stock on the date such dividend is paid by the Company to the holders
of Common Stock.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.4 <U>Vesting</U>. As of the date of grant set forth in the Grant Notice, all of the Units
(including the right to Additional Units in respect thereof) shall be unvested, and shall become
vested only in accordance with the schedule set forth in the Grant Notice. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, on the termination of Grantee&#146;s continuous status as a Director for any reason, with or
without cause, including as a result of death or Disability, the Units shall immediately cease
vesting,

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">and all Units remaining unvested as of the
date of such termination (and all rights to
any Additional Units with respect thereto as
described above) shall be immediately
forfeited, terminated and cancelled. In
addition, Additional Units credited to the
Account pursuant to Section&nbsp;1.3, shall vest
concurrently with the vesting of Units in
respect of which such Additional Units were
credited.

<u>Payment of Account</u>.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.5.1 <U>General</U>. Payment of the Account shall be made in a lump sum to the Grantee (or,
in the event of the Grantee&#146;s death, to the Grantee&#146;s beneficiary, as provided in Section&nbsp;2.3) on
the tenth business day of January of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the
Grantee&#146;s services as a member of the Board terminates for any reason. The payment shall be made
in shares of Common Stock equal to the number of Restricted Stock Units credited to the Account,
provided that any fractional Restricted Stock Units shall be paid in cash based on the Fair Market
Value of one share of Common Stock on the payment date.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.5.2 <U>Change in Control</U>. In the event of a Change in Control, the Account shall be
paid to Grantee in a lump sum in cash within five business days after the consummation of the
Change in Control, in an amount equal to the result of multiplying (i)&nbsp;the number of Restricted
Stock Units credited to the Account on the Change in Control date by (ii)&nbsp;the Fair Market Value of
one share of Common Stock on the Change in Control date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the
Change in Control involves the disposition or exchange of all of the Common Stock of the Company
for cash or securities, the price per share received by the holders of Common Stock shall be
substituted for the Fair Market Value on the Change in Control date; if the price is paid other
than solely in cash or securities with a readily determinable market value, the Board will have the
sole discretion to determine the valuation of any such portion of the price per share and shall
make such determination prior to the consummation of such Change in Control.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.6 <U>No Stockholder Rights</U>. Neither the Grantee nor any other person shall have any
rights as a stockholder of the Company with respect to the Units and Additional Units credited to
the Account until the shares of Common Stock are issued to the Grantee (or the beneficiary of the
Grantee) pursuant to Section&nbsp;1.5.1.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.&nbsp;<U>General Restrictions on Transfer of Units</U>.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.1 <U>No Transfers of Unvested Units</U>. Except as provided below with respect to
beneficiaries, in no event shall the Grantee sell, assign, transfer, pledge, hypothecate, mortgage,
encumber or dispose of any Units or Additional Units (or any right or interest therein) to any
person in any manner whatsoever, whether voluntarily or by operation of law or otherwise. Any such
purported transfer of Units and/or Additional Units shall be null and void and without force or
effect.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.2 <U>Beneficiary Designation</U>. Grantee shall have the right, at any time, to designate
any person or persons as his or her beneficiary or beneficiaries to whom payment under the Plan
shall be paid in the event of his or her death prior to payment to the Grantee of his or her
Account. Any beneficiary designation may be made or changed by Grantee by a written instrument, in
such form as prescribed by the Committee, which is filed with the Company prior to Grantee&#146;s death.
If Grantee fails to designate a beneficiary, or if all designated beneficiaries predecease
Grantee, the Account shall be paid to Grantee&#146;s estate.

requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (whether by registration or satisfaction of
exemption conditions), all applicable laws, and all applicable listing requirements of any national

Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement or the Plan to the contrary, this Agreement will be
construed, administered or deemed amended as necessary to comply with the requirements of Section

interpret the terms of the Agreement in a manner consistent therewith. Under no circumstances,
however, shall the Company or any affiliate or any of its or their employees, officers, directors,

Agreement, including any claim arising out of, in connection with, or in relation to the formation,
interpretation, performance or breach of this Agreement shall be settled exclusively by
arbitration, before a single arbitrator, in accordance with this Section&nbsp;4.12 and the then most
applicable rules of the American Arbitration Association. Judgment upon any award rendered by the
arbitrator may be entered by any state or federal court having jurisdiction thereof. Such
arbitration shall be administered by the American Arbitration Association. Arbitration shall be
the exclusive remedy for determining any such dispute, regardless of its nature. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, either party may in an appropriate matter apply to a court for provisional relief,
including a temporary restraining order or a preliminary injunction, on the ground that the award
to which the applicant may be entitled in arbitration may be rendered ineffectual without
provisional relief. Unless mutually agreed by the parties otherwise, any arbitration shall take
place in the City of Los Angeles, California.

If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator from the list so drawn, then the parties

any disputes by binding arbitration shall extend to claims against any parent, subsidiary or
affiliate of each party, and, when acting within such capacity, any officer, director, shareholder,
employee or agent of each party, or of any of the above, and shall apply as well to claims arising
out of state and federal statutes and local ordinances as well as to claims arising under the
common law. In the event of a dispute subject to this paragraph, the parties shall be entitled to
reasonable discovery subject to the discretion of the arbitrator. The remedial authority of the
arbitrator (which shall include the right to grant injunctive or other equitable relief) shall be
the same as, but no greater than, would be the remedial power of a court having jurisdiction over
the parties and their dispute. The arbitrator shall, upon an appropriate motion, dismiss any claim
without an evidentiary hearing if the party bringing the motion establishes that he or it would be
entitled to summary judgment if the matter had been pursued in court litigation. In the event of a
conflict between the applicable rules of the American Arbitration Association and these procedures,

the party requesting arbitration. The Company shall be responsible for the costs and fees of the
arbitration, unless the Grantee wishes to contribute (up to 50%) of the costs and fees of the
arbitration. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the prevailing party in such arbitration, as
determined by the arbitrator, and in any enforcement or other court proceedings, shall be entitled,
to the extent permitted by law, to reimbursement from the other party for all of the prevailing
party&#146;s costs (including but not limited to the arbitrator&#146;s compensation), expenses, and
attorneys&#146; fees.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.12.5 <U>Award Final and Binding; Severability</U>. The arbitrator shall render an award
and written opinion, and the award shall be final and binding upon the parties. If any of the
provisions of this paragraph, or of this Agreement, are determined to be unlawful or otherwise
unenforceable, in whole or in part, such determination shall not affect the validity of the
remainder of this Agreement, and this Agreement shall be reformed to the extent necessary to carry
out its provisions to the greatest extent possible and to insure that the resolution of all
conflicts between the parties, including those arising out of statutory claims, shall be resolved
by neutral, binding arbitration. If a court should find that the arbitration provisions of this
Agreement are not absolutely binding, then the parties intend any arbitration decision and award to
be fully admissible in evidence in any subsequent action, given great weight by any finder of fact,
and treated as determinative to the maximum extent permitted by law.
