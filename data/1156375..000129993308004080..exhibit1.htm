<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt">To the Addressees listed on

<U>Schedule&nbsp;I</U> hereto


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt">Ladies and Gentlemen:


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt; text-indent: 4%">I am the General Counsel of CME Group Inc., a Delaware corporation (the &#147;<U>Company</U>&#148;),
and, as such, I am furnishing this opinion in connection with that certain Commercial Paper Dealer
Agreement, dated as of August&nbsp;20, 2008 (the &#147;<U>Dealer Agreement</U>&#148;), between the Company, as
issuer, and Banc of America Securities LLC, as dealer (the &#147;<U>Dealer</U>&#148;). This opinion is
being delivered pursuant to Section&nbsp;3.6 of the Dealer Agreement.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt; text-indent: 4%">In my examination, I have assumed the genuineness of all signatures, including endorsements,
the legal capacity and competency of natural persons, the authenticity of all documents submitted
to me as originals, the conformity to original documents of all documents submitted to us as
facsimile, electronic, certified or photostatic copies, and the authenticity of the originals of
such copies. When relevant facts were not independently established, I have relied upon statements
of governmental officials and upon representations made in or pursuant to the Dealer Agreement,
certificates of appropriate representatives of the Company.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt; text-indent: 4%">In rendering the opinions set forth herein, I have examined and relied upon originals or
copies of the Dealer Agreement and such other documents as I have deemed necessary or appropriate
as a basis for the opinions set forth below.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt; text-indent: 4%">Capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined herein shall have the same meanings
herein as ascribed thereto in the Dealer Agreement. As used herein, &#147;<U>Applicable Laws</U>&#148;
means those laws, rules and regulations which, in my experience, are normally applicable to
transactions of the type contemplated by the Dealer Agreement, without my having made any special
investigation as to the applicability of any specific law, rule or regulation, and which are not
the subject of a specific opinion herein referring expressly to a particular law or laws.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt; text-indent: 4%">I am a member of the Bar of the State of Illinois and the foregoing opinions are limited to
matters involving the Federal laws of the United States of America and the General Corporation Law
of the State of Delaware and I do not express any opinion as to any other laws. I note that the
Dealer Agreement purports to be governed by the laws of the State of New York and I express no
opinion with respect to the laws of the State of New York.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt; text-indent: 4%">Based upon the foregoing and subject to the limitations, qualifications, exceptions and
assumptions set forth herein, I am of the opinion that:


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt; text-indent: 4%">1.&nbsp;The Company is a corporation validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
State of Delaware.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt; text-indent: 4%">2.&nbsp;The Company has all the requisite corporate power and authority to execute, deliver and
perform its obligations under the Dealer Agreement. The execution and delivery of the Dealer
Agreement and the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated thereby have been
duly authorized by all requisite corporate action on the part of the Company. The Dealer Agreement
has been duly executed and delivered by the Company.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt; text-indent: 4%">3.&nbsp;In the event that an Illinois court were to apply the substantive laws of the State of
Illinois, notwithstanding the choice of law of the parties set forth in the Dealer Agreement, and
without regard to choice of law principles, the Dealer Agreement constitutes the valid and binding
obligations of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms under the
Applicable Laws of the State of Illinois.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt; text-indent: 4%">4.&nbsp;The execution and delivery by the Company of the Dealer Agreement and the performance by
the Company of its obligations under the Dealer Agreement, in accordance with its terms, do not (i)
conflict with the certificate of incorporation or by-laws of the Company, (ii)&nbsp;constitute a
violation of, or a default under any material agreements or instruments known to me (after due
inquiry) to which the Company is a party or by which it is bound or to which it is subject or
result in the creation or imposition of any lien upon any property of the Company pursuant to the
terms of any such material agreement or instrument or (iii)&nbsp;violate any order, writ, injunction or
decree known to me (after due inquiry) of any court or governmental authority or agency applicable
to the Company.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt; text-indent: 4%">5.&nbsp;The offer, sale and delivery of the Notes in the manner contemplated by the Dealer
Agreement do not require registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or
qualification of any indenture under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (it being
understood that I express no opinion as to any subsequent resale of any Note); and the Notes will
rank at least pari passu with all other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness of the Company.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt; text-indent: 4%">6.&nbsp;No consent, approval or authorization of, or filing, recording or registration with, any
governmental authority, which has not been obtained or taken and is not in full force and effect,
is required to authorize, or is required in connection with, the execution or delivery of the
Dealer Agreement by the Company or the enforceability of the Dealer Agreement against the Company,
except as may be required by the securities or Blue Sky laws of the various states in connection
with the offer and sale of the Notes.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt; text-indent: 4%">7.&nbsp;To the best of my knowledge, except as disclosed in the Company&#146;s public filings with the
Securities and Exchange Commission, there is no litigation or governmental proceeding pending or
threatened against the Company or any of its subsidiaries which would have a material adverse
effect on the ability of the Company to perform its obligations under the Dealer Agreement.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt; text-indent: 4%">8.&nbsp;The Company is not an &#147;investment company&#148; within the meaning of the Investment Company Act
of 1940, as amended.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt; text-indent: 4%">My opinions are subject to the following assumptions and qualifications:


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt; text-indent: 8%">(a)&nbsp;enforcement may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium or other similar laws affecting creditors&#146; rights generally and by general principles of
equity (regardless of whether enforcement is sought in equity or at law);


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt; text-indent: 8%">(b)&nbsp;I have assumed that the Dealer Agreement constitutes the valid and binding obligation of
each party thereto (other than the Company to the extent expressly set forth herein) enforceable
against such other party in accordance with its terms;


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt; text-indent: 8%">(c)&nbsp;I express no opinion as to the effect on the opinions expressed herein of (i)&nbsp;the
compliance or non-compliance of any party (other than the Company to the extent expressly set forth
herein) to the Dealer Agreement with any state, federal or other laws or regulations applicable to
any of them or (ii)&nbsp;the legal or regulatory status or the nature of the business of any party
(other than the Company to the extent expressly set forth herein);


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt; text-indent: 8%">(d)&nbsp;I express no opinion as to the enforceability of any rights to contribution or
indemnification provided for in the Dealer Agreement which are violative of the public policy
underlying any law, rule or regulation (including any federal or state securities law, rule or
regulation);


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt; text-indent: 8%">(e)&nbsp;I express no opinion as to the applicability or effect of any fraudulent transfer,
preference or similar law on the Dealer Agreement or any transactions contemplated thereby;


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt; text-indent: 8%">(f)&nbsp;I express no opinion on the enforceability of any provision in the Dealer Agreement

<P align="left" style="margin-left:3%; font-size: 11pt">(c)&nbsp;Each Fixed Rate Note will bear interest from its Issue Date at the rate per annum
specified in the Supplement until the principal amount thereof is paid or made available for
payment. Interest on each Fixed Rate Note will be payable on the dates specified in the
Supplement (each an &#147;Interest Payment Date&#148; for a Fixed Rate Note) and on the Maturity Date
(as defined below). Interest on Fixed Rate Notes will be computed on the basis of a 360-day
year of twelve 30-day months.

Business Day, the required payment of principal, premium, if any, and/or interest will be payable

payment made on that next succeeding Business Day.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt">(d)&nbsp;The interest rate on each Floating Rate Note for each Interest Reset Period (as defined below)
will be determined by reference to an interest rate basis (a &#147;Base Rate&#148;) plus or minus a number of
basis points (one basis point equals one-hundredth of a percentage point) (the &#147;Spread&#148;), if any,
and/or multiplied by a certain percentage (the &#147;Spread Multiplier&#148;), if any, until the principal
thereof is paid or made available for payment. The Supplement will designate which of the
following Base Rates is applicable to the related Floating Rate Note: (a)&nbsp;the CD Rate (a &#147;CD Rate
Note&#148;), (b)&nbsp;the Commercial Paper Rate (a &#147;Commercial Paper Rate Note&#148;), (c)&nbsp;the Federal Funds Rate

Note&#148;), (f)&nbsp;the Treasury Rate (a &#147;Treasury Rate Note&#148;) or (g)&nbsp;such other Base Rate as may be
specified in such Supplement.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt">The rate of interest on each Floating Rate Note will be reset daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly or
semi-annually (the &#147;Interest Reset Period&#148;). The date or dates on which interest will be reset
(each an &#147;Interest Reset Date&#148;) will be, unless otherwise specified in the Supplement, in the case
of Floating Rate Notes which reset daily, each Business Day, in the case of Floating Rate Notes
(other than Treasury Rate Notes) that reset weekly, the Wednesday of each week; in the case of
Treasury Rate Notes that reset weekly, the Tuesday of each week; in the case of Floating Rate Notes
that reset monthly, the third Wednesday of each month; in the case of Floating Rate Notes that
reset quarterly, the third Wednesday of March, June, September and December; and in the case of
Floating Rate Notes that reset semiannually, the third Wednesday of the two months specified in the
Supplement. If any Interest Reset Date for any Floating Rate Note is not a Business Day, such
Interest Reset Date will be postponed to the next day that is a Business Day, except that in the
case of a LIBOR Note, if such Business Day is in the next succeeding calendar month, such Interest
Reset Date shall be the immediately preceding Business Day. Interest on each Floating Rate Note
will be payable monthly, quarterly or semiannually (the &#147;Interest Payment Period&#148;) and on the
Maturity Date. Unless otherwise specified in the Supplement, and except as provided below, the
date or dates on which interest will be payable (each an &#147;Interest Payment Date&#148; for a Floating
Rate Note) will be, in the case of Floating Rate Notes with a monthly Interest Payment Period, on
the third Wednesday of each month; in the case of Floating Rate Notes with a quarterly Interest
Payment Period, on the third Wednesday of March, June, September and December; and in the case of
Floating Rate Notes with a semiannual Interest Payment Period, on the third Wednesday of the two
months specified in the Supplement. In addition, the Maturity Date will also be an Interest
Payment Date.

occurring on the Maturity Date) would otherwise be a day that is not a Business Day, such Interest
Payment Date shall be postponed to the next day that is a Business Day, except that in the case of
a LIBOR Note, if such Business Day is in the next succeeding calendar month, such Interest Payment
Date shall be the immediately preceding Business Day. If the Maturity Date of a Floating Rate Note
falls on a day that is not a Business Day, the payment of principal and interest will be made on
the next succeeding Business Day, and no interest on such payment shall accrue for the period from
and after such maturity.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt">Interest payments on each Interest Payment Date for Floating Rate Notes will include accrued
interest from and including the Issue Date or from and including the last date in respect of which
interest has been paid, as the case may be, to, but excluding, such Interest Payment Date. On the
Maturity Date, the interest payable on a Floating Rate Note will include interest accrued to, but
excluding, the Maturity Date. Accrued interest will be calculated by multiplying the principal
amount of a Floating Rate Note by an accrued interest factor. This accrued interest factor will be
computed by adding the interest factors calculated for each day in the period for which accrued
interest is being calculated. The interest factor (expressed as a decimal) for each such day will
be computed by dividing the interest rate applicable to such day by 360, in the cases where the
Base Rate is the CD Rate, Commercial Paper Rate, Federal Funds Rate, LIBOR or Prime Rate, or by the
actual number of days in the year, in the case where the Base Rate is the Treasury Rate. The
interest rate in effect on each day will be (i)&nbsp;if such day is an Interest Reset Date, the interest
rate with respect to the Interest Determination Date (as defined below) pertaining to such Interest
Reset Date, or (ii)&nbsp;if such day is not an Interest Reset Date, the interest rate with respect to
the Interest Determination Date pertaining to the next preceding Interest Reset Date, subject in
either case to any adjustment by a Spread and/or a Spread Multiplier.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt">The &#147;Interest Determination Date&#148; where the Base Rate is the CD Rate or the Commercial Paper Rate
will be the second Business Day next preceding an Interest Reset Date. The Interest Determination
Date where the Base Rate is the Federal Funds Rate or the Prime Rate will be the Business Day next
preceding an Interest Reset Date. The Interest Determination Date where the Base Rate is LIBOR
will be the second London Business Day next preceding an Interest Reset Date. The Interest
Determination Date where the Base Rate is the Treasury Rate will be the day of the week in which
such Interest Reset Date falls when Treasury Bills are normally auctioned. Treasury Bills are
normally sold at auction on Monday of each week, unless that day is a legal holiday, in which case
the auction is held on the following Tuesday or the preceding Friday. If an auction is so held on
the preceding Friday, such Friday will be the Interest Determination Date pertaining to the
Interest Reset Date occurring in the next succeeding week.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt">The &#147;Index Maturity&#148; is the period to maturity of the instrument or obligation from which the
applicable Base Rate is calculated.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt">The &#147;Calculation Date,&#148; where applicable, shall be the earlier of (i)&nbsp;the tenth calendar day
following the applicable Interest Determination Date or (ii)&nbsp;the Business Day preceding the
applicable Interest Payment Date or Maturity Date.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt">All times referred to herein reflect New York City time, unless otherwise specified.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt">The Issuer shall specify in writing to the Issuing and Paying Agent which party will be the
calculation agent (the &#147;Calculation Agent&#148;) with respect to the Floating Rate Notes. The
Calculation Agent will provide the interest rate then in effect and, if determined, the interest
rate which will become effective on the next Interest Reset Date with respect to such Floating Rate
Note to the Issuing and Paying Agent as soon as the interest rate with respect to such Floating
Rate Note has been determined and as soon as practicable after any change in such interest rate.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt">All percentages resulting from any calculation on Floating Rate Notes will be rounded to the
nearest one hundred-thousandth of a percentage point, with five-one millionths of a percentage
point rounded upwards. For example, 9.876545% (or .09876545) would be rounded to 9.87655% (or
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.0987655). All dollar amounts used in or resulting from any calculation on Floating Rate Notes
will be rounded, in the case of U.S. dollars, to the nearest cent or, in the case of a foreign
currency, to the nearest unit (with one-half cent or unit being rounded upwards).

<P align="left" style="margin-left:2%; font-size: 11pt">If such rate is not published in either H.15(519) or H.15 Daily Update by 3:00 p.m. on the
Calculation Date, the Calculation Agent will determine the CD Rate to be the arithmetic mean of
the secondary market offered rates as of 10:00&nbsp;a.m. on such Interest Determination Date of three
leading nonbank dealers in negotiable U.S. dollar certificates of deposit in New York City
selected by the Calculation Agent for negotiable U.S. dollar certificates of deposit of major
