additional  overhead  expenses  incurred, which shall remain in force and effect
until  the monthly overhead rates are adjusted by agreement between the parties.

Nothing  contained  in  this  agreement  shall be deemed in any way or manner to
prohibit  or  restrict  in  any  way the right or freedom of any party hereto to
engage  in  oil and gas activities outside the Tambaqui Block in Colombia, South
America.  However, if either party hereto enters into a geological project, such
as  geological  mapping  or other oil and gas activity and decides to go forward
with  an  oil  and  gas  project  and  enters into an association contract, both
parties to this agreement agree to offer each other the right to participate for
a  twelve  and  one-half  percent  (12  %) working interest on or at cost basis,
whether  it  be  with  the companies that are subject to this agreement or their
principles  or  assigns  for  a  period  of  five  years  from  the date of this
agreement.

If  the  foregoing  terms  and  conditions  are  acceptable, please execute your
