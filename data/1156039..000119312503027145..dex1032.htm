Directors (the &#147;Committee&#148;), as from time to time constituted pursuant to the By-laws of the Company, may authorize the establishment of various award levels, including threshold, target and maximum awards (&#147;Award Levels&#148;) for
associates based on performance goals established for each calendar year (hereinafter referred to as a &#147;Performance Period&#148;). The Committee shall consist of at least two non-employee directors, and all directors on the Committee shall
satisfy the requirements for an &#147;outside director&#148; as that term is defined under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, and the regulations promulgated thereunder (the &#147;Code&#148;). The Committee, in its sole discretion,
shall determine in writing the performance goals at which different Award Levels shall be earned, the collective amount for all Award Levels to be established at any one time, the eligibility criteria for participation in the AIP, the associates of
the Company who are officers of the Company (including those whom the Committee believes may be covered employees as defined under Section 162(m) of the Code (&#147;Covered Employees&#148;)) who will be eligible to participate in the AIP, and the
individual Award Levels for associates who are officers of the Company (including those who the Committee believes may be Covered Employees). The Committee may delegate to the Company&#146;s Chief Executive Officer (who may in turn delegate to other
officers) responsibility for determining, within the limits established by the Committee, individual Award Levels for associates who are not officers of the Company (including those whom the Committee does not believe will be Covered Employees).

policyholders or insureds; quality of service metrics; customer service metrics; productivity; administrative expense management; or improved health of members. The specific performance goals for associates who are not Covered Employees may be based
on one or more of the foregoing business criteria or any other criteria determined by the Committee. Any business criteria may be used with or without adjustment for extraordinary items or nonrecurring items. The business criteria may be expressed
