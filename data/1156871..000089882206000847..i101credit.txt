each Lender having a Revolving Credit Commitment severally agrees to make a loan

Loans of the same Type, (C) may be repaid and reborrowed in accordance with the
provisions hereof, (D) shall not, for any such Lender at any time, after giving

thereto and to the application of the proceeds thereof, result at any time in
the aggregate amount of the Lenders' Revolving Credit Exposures at such time
exceeding the Total Revolving Credit Commitment then in effect; PROVIDED that no

effect thereto and any issuances of Letters of Credit and other borrowings of
Revolving Loans and Swingline Loans on such day, the Intelsat Ltd. Notes
Condition is not satisfied.

          (ii) Each Lender may at its option make any LIBOR Loan by causing any
domestic or foreign branch or Affiliate of such Lender to make such Loan,
PROVIDED that (A) any exercise of such option shall not affect the obligation of
the Borrower to repay such Loan and (B) in exercising such option, such Lender
shall use its reasonable efforts to minimize any increased costs to the Borrower

<PAGE>

after giving effect thereto and to the application of the proceeds thereof,
result at any time in the aggregate amount of the Lenders' Revolving Credit
Exposures at such time exceeding the Total Revolving Credit Commitment then in
effect and (v) may be repaid and reborrowed in accordance with the provisions
hereof; PROVIDED that no Swingline Loans shall be made to the Borrower on any
day if, after giving effect thereto and any issuances of Letters of Credit and
other borrowings of Revolving Loans and Swingline Loans on such day, the
Intelsat Ltd. Notes Condition is not satisfied. On the Swingline Maturity Date,
each outstanding Swingline Loan shall be repaid in full. The Swingline Lender
shall not make any Swingline Loan after receiving a written notice from the
Borrower or any Lender stating that a Default or Event of Default exists and is
continuing until such time as the Swingline Lender shall have received written
notice of (i) rescission of all such notices from the party or parties
originally delivering such notice or (ii) the waiver of such Default or Event of
Default in accordance with the provisions of Section 14.1.

          (d) On any Business Day, the Swingline Lender may, in its sole
discretion, give notice to the Lenders with a Revolving Credit Commitment that
all then-outstanding Swingline Loans shall be funded with a Borrowing of

Loans (each such Borrowing, a "MANDATORY BORROWING") shall be made on the
immediately succeeding Business Day by all Lenders with a Revolving Credit
Commitment PRO RATA based on each Lender's Revolving Credit Commitment
Percentage, and the proceeds thereof shall be applied directly to the Swingline
Lender to repay the Swingline Lender for such outstanding Swingline Loans. Each
Lender with a Revolving Credit Commitment hereby irrevocably agrees to make such
Revolving Credit Loans upon one Business Day's notice pursuant to each Mandatory
Borrowing in the amount and in the manner specified in the preceding sentence
and on the date specified to it in writing by the Swingline Lender
notwithstanding (i) that the amount of the Mandatory Borrowing may not comply
with the minimum amount for each Borrowing specified in Section 2.2, (ii)
whether any conditions specified in Section 7 are then satisfied, (iii) whether
a Default or an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, (iv) the date
of such Mandatory Borrowing or (v) any reduction in the Total Commitment after
any such Swingline Loans were made. In the event that, in the sole judgment of
the Swingline Lender, any Mandatory Borrowing cannot for any reason be made on
the date otherwise required above (including as a result of the commencement of
a proceeding under the Bankruptcy Code in respect of the Borrower), each Lender
with a Revolving Credit Commitment hereby agrees that it shall forthwith
purchase from the Swingline Lender (without recourse or warranty) such
participation of the outstanding Swingline Loans as shall be necessary to cause
the Lenders to share in such Swingline Loans ratably based upon their respective
Revolving Credit Commitment Percentages, PROVIDED that all principal and
interest payable on such Swingline Loans shall be for the account of the
Swingline Lender until the date the respective participation is purchased and,
to the extent attributable to the purchased participation, shall be payable to
the Lender purchasing same from and after such date of purchase.

          2.2. MINIMUM AMOUNT OF EACH BORROWING; MAXIMUM NUMBER OF BORROWINGS.
The aggregate principal amount of each Borrowing of Term Loans or Revolving
Credit Loans shall be in a multiple of $1,000,000 and Swingline Loans shall be
in a multiple of $10,000 and, in each case, shall not be less than the Minimum
Borrowing Amount with respect thereto (except that Mandatory Borrowings shall be
made in the amounts required by Section 2.1(d)).

                                       -50-
<PAGE>


More than one Borrowing may be incurred on any date, PROVIDED that at no time

Loans to be made, (ii) the date of the Borrowing (which shall be the Closing
Date) and (iii) whether the Term Loans shall consist of ABR Loans and/or LIBOR
Term Loans and, if the Term Loans are to include LIBOR Term Loans, the Interest
Period to be initially applicable thereto. In any such Notice of Borrowing
relating to a Borrowing of Incremental Tranche B Term Loans, Borrower shall also
certify that the Intelsat Ltd. Notes Condition has been satisfied. The
Administrative Agent shall promptly give each Lender written notice (or

Term Loans, of such Lender's proportionate share thereof and of the other
matters covered by the related Notice of Borrowing.

          (b) Whenever the Borrower desires to incur Revolving Credit Loans

Borrowing of LIBOR Revolving Credit Loans, and (ii) prior to 12:00 Noon (New
York City time) at least one Business Day's prior written notice (or telephonic
notice promptly confirmed in writing) of each Borrowing of ABR Loans. Each such
Notice of Borrowing, except as otherwise expressly provided in Section 2.10,
shall be irrevocable and shall specify (i) the aggregate principal amount of the
Revolving Credit Loans to be made pursuant to such Borrowing, (ii) the date of
Borrowing (which shall be a Business Day) and (iii) whether the respective
Borrowing shall consist of ABR Loans or LIBOR Revolving Credit Loans and, if
LIBOR Revolving Credit Loans, the Interest Period to be initially applicable
thereto. In each such Notice of Borrowing, Borrower shall also certify that the
Intelsat Ltd. Notes Condition has been satisfied. The Administrative Agent shall
promptly give each Lender written notice (or telephonic notice promptly
confirmed in writing) of each proposed Borrowing of Revolving Credit Loans, of
such Lender's proportionate share thereof and of the other matters covered by
the related Notice of Borrowing.

          (c) Whenever the Borrower desires to incur Swingline Loans hereunder,
it shall give the Administrative Agent written notice (or telephonic notice
promptly confirmed in writing) of each Borrowing of Swingline Loans prior to
2:30 p.m. (New York City time) on the date of such Borrowing. Each such notice
shall be irrevocable and shall specify (i) the aggregate principal amount of the
Swingline Loans to be made pursuant to such Borrowing and (ii) the date


                                       -51-
<PAGE>

Borrower shall also certify that the Intelsat Ltd. Notes Condition has been
satisfied. The Administrative Agent shall promptly give the Swingline Lender
written notice (or telephonic notice promptly confirmed in writing) of each
proposed Borrowing of Swingline Loans and of the other matters covered by the
related Notice of Borrowing.

          (d) Mandatory Borrowings shall be made upon the notice specified in
Section 2.1(d), with the Borrower irrevocably agreeing, by its incurrence of any
Swingline Loan, to the making of Mandatory Borrowings as set forth in such
Section.

          (e) Borrowings to reimburse Unpaid Drawings shall be made upon the
notice specified in Section 3.4(a).

          (f) Without in any way limiting the obligation of the Borrower to
confirm in writing any notice it may give hereunder by telephone, the
Administrative Agent may act prior to receipt of written confirmation without
liability upon the basis of such telephonic notice believed by the
Administrative Agent in good faith to be from an Authorized Officer of the
Borrower. In each such case, the Borrower hereby waives the right to dispute the
Administrative Agent's record of the terms of any such telephonic notice.

          2.4. DISBURSEMENT OF FUNDS.

          (a) No later than 12:00 Noon (New York City time) on the date
specified in each Notice of Borrowing (including Mandatory Borrowings), each
Lender will make available its PRO RATA portion, if any, of each Borrowing
requested to be made on such date in the manner provided below, provided that
all Swingline Loans shall be made available in the full amount thereof by the
Swingline Lender no later than 3:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the date
requested.

          (b) Each Lender shall make available all amounts it is to fund to the
Borrower under any Borrowing for its applicable Commitments, and in immediately
available funds to the Administrative Agent at the Administrative Agent's Office
and the Administrative Agent will (except in the case of Mandatory Borrowings
and Borrowings to repay Unpaid Drawings) make available to the Borrower, by
depositing to the Borrower's account at the Administrative Agent's Office the
aggregate of the amounts so made available in Dollars. Unless the Administrative
Agent shall have been notified by any Lender prior to the date of any such
Borrowing that such Lender does not intend to make available to the
Administrative Agent its portion of the Borrowing or Borrowings to be made on
such date, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such
amount available to the Administrative Agent on such date of Borrowing, and the
Administrative Agent, in reliance upon such assumption, may (in its sole
discretion and without any obligation to do so) make available to the Borrower a
corresponding amount. If such corresponding amount is not in fact made available
to the Administrative Agent by such Lender and the Administrative Agent has made
available same to the Borrower, the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to
recover such corresponding amount from such Lender. If such Lender does not pay
such corresponding amount forthwith upon the Administrative Agent's demand
therefor the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower and the
Borrower shall immediately pay such corresponding amount to the Administrative
Agent. The Administra-

                                       -52-
<PAGE>

tive Agent shall also be entitled to recover from such Lender or the Borrower
interest on such corresponding amount in respect of each day from the date such
corresponding amount was made available by the Administrative Agent to the
Borrower to the date such corresponding amount is recovered by the
Administrative Agent, at a rate PER ANNUM equal to (i) if paid by such Lender,
the Federal Funds Effective Rate or (ii) if paid by the Borrower, the
then-applicable rate of interest or fees, calculated in accordance with Section
2.8, for the respective Loans.

          (c) Nothing in this Section 2.4 shall be deemed to relieve any Lender
from its obligation to fulfill its commitments hereunder or to prejudice any
rights that the Borrower may have against any Lender as a result of any default
by such Lender hereunder (it being understood, however, that no Lender shall be
responsible for the failure of any other Lender to fulfill its commitments
hereunder).

          2.5. REPAYMENT OF LOANS; EVIDENCE OF DEBT.

          (a) The Borrower shall repay to the Administrative Agent, for the
benefit of the Lenders, on the Tranche B Term Loan Maturity Date, the
then-unpaid Tranche B Term Loans, in Dollars. The Borrower shall repay to the
Administrative Agent in Dollars, for the benefit of the applicable Lenders, on
the Revolving Credit Maturity Date, the then-unpaid Revolving Credit Loans made

Dollars, for the account of the Swingline Lender, on the Swingline Maturity
Date, the then-unpaid Swingline Loans.

          (b) [INTENTIONALLY OMITTED]

; PROVIDED, in the event any Incremental Tranche B Term Loans are made, such
Incremental Tranche B Term Loans shall be repaid on each Repayment Date
occurring on or after the applicable Increased Amount Date in an amount equal to
(i) the aggregate principal amount of Incremental Tranche B Term Loans of the
applicable Series of Incremental Tranche B Term Loans times (ii) the ratio
(expressed as a percentage) of (y) the amount of all other Tranche B Term Loans
being repaid on such Repayment Date to (z) the total aggregate principal amount
of all other Tranche B Term Loans outstanding on such Increased Amount Date.

          (d) Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice
an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of the Borrower to the
appropriate lending office of such Lender resulting from each Loan made by such
lending office of such Lender from time to time, including the amounts of
principal and interest payable and paid to such lending office of such Lender
from time to time under this Agreement.

          (e) The Administrative Agent shall maintain the Register pursuant to
Section 14.6(b), and a subaccount for each Lender, in which Register and
subaccounts (taken together) shall be recorded (i) the amount of each Loan made
hereunder, whether such Loan is a Term Loan, a Revolving Credit Loan or a
Swingline Loan, the Type of each Loan made and the Interest Period applicable
thereto, (ii) the amount of any principal or interest due and payable or to
become due and payable from the Borrower to each Lender or the Swingline Lender
hereunder and (iii) the amount of any sum received by the Administrative Agent
hereunder from the Borrower and each Lender's share thereof.

          (f) The entries made in the Register and accounts and subaccounts
maintained pursuant to paragraphs (d) and (e) of this Section 2.5 shall, to the
extent permitted by applicable law, be prima facie evidence of the existence and
amounts of the obligations of the Borrower therein recorded; PROVIDED, HOWEVER,
that the failure of any Lender or the Administrative Agent

                                       -54-
<PAGE>

to maintain such account, such Register or such subaccount, as applicable, or
any error therein, shall not in any manner affect the obligation of the Borrower
to repay (with applicable interest) the Loans made to the Borrower by such
Lender in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

          2.6. CONVERSIONS AND CONTINUATIONS.

          (a) The Borrower shall have the option on any Business Day to convert
all or a portion equal to at least the Minimum Borrowing Amount of the
outstanding principal amount of Term Loans or Revolving Credit Loans made to the
Borrower (as applicable) of one Type into a Borrowing or Borrowings of another
Type and the Borrower shall have the option on any Business Day to continue the
outstanding principal amount of any LIBOR Term Loans or LIBOR Revolving Credit
Loans as LIBOR Term Loans or LIBOR Revolving Credit Loans, as the case may be,
for an additional Interest Period, PROVIDED that (i) no partial conversion of
LIBOR Term Loans or LIBOR Revolving Credit Loans shall reduce the outstanding
principal amount of LIBOR Term Loans or LIBOR Revolving Credit Loans made
pursuant to a single Borrowing to less than the Minimum Borrowing Amount, (ii)
ABR Loans may not be converted into LIBOR Term Loans or LIBOR Revolving Credit
Loans if a Default or Event of Default is in existence on the date of the
conversion and the Administrative Agent has or the Required Lenders have
determined in its or their sole discretion not to permit such conversion, (iii)
LIBOR Loans may not be continued as LIBOR Loans for an additional Interest
Period if a Default or Event of Default is in existence on the date of the
proposed continuation and the Administrative Agent has or the Required Lenders
have determined in its or their sole discretion not to permit such continuation
and (iv) Borrowings resulting from conversions pursuant to this Section 2.6
shall be limited in number as provided in Section 2.2. Each such conversion or
continuation shall be effected by the Borrower by giving the Administrative
Agent at the Administrative Agent's Office prior to 12:00 Noon (New York City
time) at least three Business Days' (or one Business Day's notice in the case of
a conversion into ABR Loans) prior written notice (or telephonic notice promptly
confirmed in writing) (each, a "NOTICE OF CONVERSION OR CONTINUATION")
specifying the Term Loans or Revolving Credit Loans to be so converted or
continued, the Type of Term Loans or Revolving Credit Loans to be converted or
continued into and, if such Term Loans or Revolving Credit Loans are to be
converted into or continued as LIBOR Loans, the Interest Period to be initially
applicable thereto. The Administrative Agent shall give each Lender notice as
promptly as practicable of any such proposed conversion or continuation
affecting any of its Term Loans or Revolving Credit Loans.

          (b) If any Default or Event of Default is in existence at the time of
any proposed continuation of any LIBOR Loans and the Administrative Agent has or
the Required Lenders have determined in its or their sole discretion not to
permit such continuation, such LIBOR Loans shall be automatically converted on
the last day of the current Interest Period into ABR Loans. If upon the
expiration of any Interest Period in respect of LIBOR Loans, the Borrower has
failed to elect a new Interest Period to be applicable thereto as provided in
paragraph (a) above, the Borrower shall be deemed to have elected to continue
such Borrowing of LIBOR Loans into a Borrowing of ABR Loans, effective as of the
expiration date of such current Interest Period.

          2.7. PRO RATA BORROWINGS. Each Borrowing of Tranche B Term Loans under
this Agreement shall be granted by the Lenders PRO RATA on the basis of their
then-applicable Tranche B Term Loan Commitments. Each Borrowing of Revolving
Credit Loans under this Agreement shall be granted by the Lenders PRO RATA on
the basis of their then-applicable Revolving Credit Commitments. Each Borrowing
of Incremental Tranche B Term Loans under this Agreement shall be granted by the
Lenders PRO RATA on the basis of their then-applicable Incremental Tranche B
Term Loan Commitments. It is understood that no Lender shall be responsible for
any default by any other Lender in its obligation to make Loans hereunder and
that each Lender shall be obligated to make the Loans provided to be made by it
hereunder, regardless of the failure of any other Lender to fulfill its
commitments hereunder.

          2.8. INTEREST.

          (a) The unpaid principal amount of each ABR Loan shall bear interest
from the date of the Borrowing thereof until maturity (whether by acceleration
or otherwise) at a rate PER ANNUM that shall at all times be the Applicable ABR
Margin plus the ABR in effect from time to time.

          (b) The unpaid principal amount of each LIBOR Loan shall bear interest
from the date of the Borrowing thereof until maturity thereof (whether by
acceleration or otherwise) at a rate PER annum that shall at all times be the
Applicable LIBOR Margin in effect from time to time plus the relevant LIBOR
Rate.

          (c) If all or a portion of (i) the principal amount of any Loan or
(ii) any interest payable thereon shall not be paid when due (whether at the
stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise), such overdue amount shall bear
interest at a rate PER ANNUM that is (x) in the case of overdue principal, the
rate that would otherwise be applicable thereto PLUS 2% or (y) in the case of
any overdue interest, to the extent permitted by applicable law, the rate
described in Section 2.8(a) PLUS 2% from and including the date of such
non-payment to but excluding the date on which such amount is paid in full
(after as well as before judgment).

          (d) Interest on each Loan shall accrue from and including the date of
any Borrowing to but excluding the date of any repayment thereof and shall be
payable (i) in respect of each ABR Loan, quarterly in arrears on the last day of
each March, June, September and December, (ii) in respect of each LIBOR Loan, on
the last day of each Interest Period applicable thereto and, in the case of an
Interest Period in excess of three months, on each date occurring at three-month
intervals after the first day of such Interest Period, (iii) in respect of each
Loan (except, other than in the case of prepayments, any ABR Loan), on any
prepayment (on the amount prepaid), at maturity (whether by acceleration or
otherwise) and, after such maturity, on demand.

          (e) All computations of interest hereunder shall be made in accordance
with Section 5.5.

          (f) The Administrative Agent, upon determining the interest rate for
any Borrowing of LIBOR Loans, shall promptly notify the Borrower and the
relevant Lenders thereof. Each such determination shall, absent clearly
demonstrable error, be final and conclusive and binding on all parties hereto.

                                       -56-

          2.9. INTEREST PERIODS. At the time the Borrower gives a Notice of
Borrowing or Notice of Conversion or Continuation in respect of the making of,
or conversion into or continuation as, a Borrowing of LIBOR Loans (in the case
of the initial Interest Period applicable thereto) or prior to 10:00 a.m. (New
York City time) on the third Business Day prior to the expiration of an Interest
Period applicable to a Borrowing of LIBOR Loans, the Borrower shall have the
right to elect by giving the Administrative Agent written notice (or telephonic
notice promptly confirmed in writing) the Interest Period applicable to such
Borrowing, which Interest Period shall, at the option of the Borrower be a one,
two, three, six or (in the case of Revolving Credit Loans, if available to all
the Lenders making such loans as determined by such Lenders in good faith based
on prevailing market conditions) a nine or twelve month period, PROVIDED that
the initial Interest Period may be for a period less than one month if agreed
upon by the Borrower and the Agents.

           Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained above:

          (a) the initial Interest Period for any Borrowing of LIBOR Loans shall
     commence on the date of such Borrowing (including the date of any
     conversion from a Borrowing of ABR Loans or) and each Interest Period
     occurring thereafter in respect of such Borrowing shall commence on the day
     on which the next preceding Interest Period expires;

          (b) if any Interest Period relating to a Borrowing of LIBOR Revolving
     Credit Loans begins on the last Business Day of a calendar month or begins
     on a day for which there is no numerically corresponding day in the
     calendar month at the end of such Interest Period, such Interest Period
     shall end on the last Business Day of the calendar month at the end of such
     Interest Period;

          (c) if any Interest Period would otherwise expire on a day that is not
     a Business Day, such Interest Period shall expire on the next succeeding
     Business Day, PROVIDED that if any Interest Period in respect of a LIBOR
     Loan would otherwise expire on a day that is not a Business Day but is a
     day of the month after which no further Business Day occurs in such month,
     such Interest Period shall expire on the next preceding Business Day; and

          (d) the Borrower shall not be entitled to elect any Interest Period in
     respect of any LIBOR Loan if such Interest Period would extend beyond the
     applicable Maturity Date of such Loan.

          2.10. INCREASED COSTS, ILLEGALITY, ETC.

          (a) In the event that (x) in the case of clause (i) below, the
Administrative Agent or (y) in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii) below, any
Lender shall have reasonably determined (which determination shall, absent
clearly demonstrable error, be final and conclusive and binding upon all parties
hereto):

          (i) on any date for determining the LIBOR Rate for any Interest Period
     that (x) deposits in the principal amounts of the Loans comprising such
     LIBOR Borrowing

                                       -57-
<PAGE>

     are not generally available in the relevant market or (y) by reason of any
     changes arising on or after the Closing Date affecting the interbank LIBOR
     market, adequate and fair means do not exist for ascertaining the
     applicable interest rate on the basis provided for in the definition of
     LIBOR Rate; or

          (ii) at any time, that such Lender shall incur increased costs or
     reductions in the amounts received or receivable hereunder with respect to
     any LIBOR Loans (other than any such increase or reduction attributable to
     Taxes) because of (x) any change since the Closing Date in any applicable
     law, governmental rule, regulation, guideline or order (or in the
     interpretation or administration thereof and including the introduction of
     any new law or governmental rule, regulation, guideline or order), such as,
     for example, without limitation, a change in official reserve requirements,
     and/or (y) other circumstances affecting the interbank LIBOR market or the
     position of such Lender in such market; or

          (iii) at any time, that the making or continuance of any LIBOR Loan
     has become unlawful by compliance by such Lender in good faith with any
     law, governmental rule, regulation, guideline or order (or would conflict
     with any such governmental rule, regulation, guideline or order not having
     the force of law even though the failure to comply therewith would not be
     unlawful), or has become impracticable as a result of a contingency
     occurring after the Closing Date that materially and adversely affects the
     interbank LIBOR market;

then, and in any such event, such Lender (or the Administrative Agent, in the
case of clause (i) above) shall within a reasonable time thereafter give notice
(if by telephone, confirmed in writing) to the Borrower and to the
Administrative Agent of such determination (which notice the Administrative
Agent shall promptly transmit to each of the other Lenders). Thereafter (x) in
the case of clause (i) above, LIBOR Term Loans and LIBOR Revolving Credit Loans
shall no longer be available until such time as the Administrative Agent
notifies the Borrower and the Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such
notice by the Administrative Agent no longer exist (which notice the
Administrative Agent agrees to give at such time when such circumstances no
longer exist), and any Notice of Borrowing or Notice of Conversion given by the
Borrower with respect to LIBOR Term Loans or LIBOR Revolving Credit Loans that
have not yet been incurred shall be deemed rescinded by the Borrower (y) in the
case of clause (ii) above, the Borrower shall pay to such Lender, promptly after
receipt of written demand therefor such additional amounts (in the form of an
increased rate of, or a different method of calculating, interest or otherwise
as such Lender in its reasonable discretion shall determine) as shall be
required to compensate such Lender for such increased costs or reductions in
amounts receivable hereunder (it being agreed that a written notice as to the
additional amounts owed to such Lender, showing in reasonable detail the basis
for the calculation thereof, submitted to the Borrower by such Lender shall,
absent clearly demonstrable error, be final and conclusive and binding upon all
parties hereto) and (z) in the case of clause (iii) above, the Borrower shall
take one of the actions specified in Section 2.10(b) as promptly as possible
and, in any event, within the time period required by law.

                                       -58-
<PAGE>

          (b) At any time that any LIBOR Loan is affected by the circumstances
described in Section 2.10(a)(ii) or (iii), the Borrower may (and in the case of
a LIBOR Loan affected pursuant to Section 2.10(a)(iii) shall) either (x) if the
affected LIBOR Loan is then being made pursuant to a Borrowing, cancel said
Borrowing by giving the Administrative Agent telephonic notice (confirmed
promptly in writing) thereof on the same date that the Borrower was notified by
a Lender pursuant to Section 2.10(a)(ii) or (iii) or (y) if the affected LIBOR
Loan is then outstanding, upon at least three Business Days' notice to the
Administrative Agent, require the affected Lender to convert each such LIBOR
Revolving Credit Loan and LIBOR Term Loan into an ABR Loan, PROVIDED that if
more than one Lender is affected at any time, then all affected Lenders must be
treated in the same manner pursuant to this Section 2.10(b).

          (c) If, after the Closing Date, the adoption of any applicable law,
rule or regulation regarding capital adequacy, or any change therein, or any
change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any governmental
authority, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, central bank or
comparable agency charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or
compliance by a Lender or its parent with any request or directive made or
adopted after the Closing Date regarding capital adequacy (whether or not having
the force of law) of any such authority, association, central bank or comparable
agency, has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such
Lender's or its parent's or its Affiliate's capital or assets as a consequence
of such Lender's commitments or obligations hereunder to a level below that
which such Lender or its parent or its Affiliate could have achieved but for
such adoption, effectiveness, change or compliance (taking into consideration
such Lender's or its parent's policies with respect to capital adequacy), then
from time to time, promptly after demand by such Lender (with a copy to the
Administrative Agent), the Borrower shall pay to such Lender such additional
amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or its parent for such
reduction, it being understood and agreed, however, that a Lender shall not be
entitled to such compensation as a result of such Lender's compliance with, or
pursuant to any request or directive to comply with, any such law, rule or
regulation as in effect on the Closing Date. Each Lender, upon determining in
good faith that any additional amounts will be payable pursuant to this Section
2.10(c), will give prompt written notice thereof to the Borrower which notice
shall set forth in reasonable detail the basis of the calculation of such
additional amounts, although the failure to give any such notice shall not,
subject to Section 2.13, release or diminish the Borrower's obligations to pay
additional amounts pursuant to this Section 2.10(c) upon receipt of such notice.

          (d) It is understood that to the extent duplicative of Section 5.4,
this Section 2.10 shall not apply to Taxes.

          2.11. COMPENSATION. If (a) any payment of principal of any LIBOR Loan
is made by the Borrower to or for the account of a Lender other than on the last
day of the Interest Period for such LIBOR Loan as a result of a payment or
conversion pursuant to Section 2.5, 2.6, 2.10, 5.1, 5.2 or 14.7, as a result of
acceleration of the maturity of the Loans pursuant to Section 11 or for any
other reason, (b) any Borrowing of LIBOR Loans is not made as a result of a
withdrawn Notice of Borrowing, (c) any ABR Loan is not converted into a LIBOR
Loan as a result of a withdrawn Notice of Conversion or Continuation, (d) any
LIBOR Loan is not continued as an LIBOR Loan, as the case may be, as a result of
a withdrawn Notice of Conversion or Continuation or (e) any prepayment of
principal of any LIBOR Loan is not made as a result of a

                                       -59-
<PAGE>

withdrawn notice of prepayment pursuant to Section 5.1 or 5.2, the Borrower
shall, after receipt of a written request by such Lender (which request shall
set forth in reasonable detail the basis for requesting such amount), pay to the
Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender any amounts required to
compensate such Lender for any additional losses, costs or expenses that such
Lender may reasonably incur as a result of such payment, failure to convert,
failure to continue or failure to prepay, including any loss, cost or expense
(excluding loss of anticipated profits) actually incurred by reason of the
liquidation or reemployment of deposits or other funds acquired by any Lender to
fund or maintain such LIBOR Loan.

          2.12. CHANGE OF LENDING OFFICE. Each Lender agrees that, upon the
occurrence of any event giving rise to the operation of Section 2.10(a)(ii),
2.10(a)(iii), 2.10(b), 3.5 or 5.4 with respect to such Lender, it will, if
requested by the Borrower use reasonable efforts (subject to overall policy
considerations of such Lender) to designate another lending office for any Loans
affected by such event, PROVIDED that such designation is made on such terms
that such Lender and its lending office suffer no economic, legal or regulatory
disadvantage, with the object of avoiding the consequence of the event giving
rise to the operation of any such Section. Nothing in this Section 2.12 shall
affect or postpone any of the obligations of the Borrower or the right of any
Lender provided in Section 2.10, 3.5 or 5.4.

          2.13. NOTICE OF CERTAIN COSTS. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, to the extent any notice required by Section 2.10,
2.11, 3.5 or 5.4 is given by any Lender more than 90 days after such Lender has
knowledge (or should have had knowledge) of the occurrence of the event giving
rise to the additional cost, reduction in amounts, loss, tax or other additional
amounts described in such Sections, such Lender shall not be entitled to
compensation under Section 2.10, 2.11, 3.5 or 5.4, as the case may be, for any
such amounts incurred or accruing prior to the 91st day prior to the giving of
such notice to the Borrower.

          2.14. INCREMENTAL FACILITIES. The Borrower may by written notice to
the Administrative Agent elect to request the establishment of one or more (x)
Incremental Tranche B Term Loan commitments (the "INCREMENTAL TRANCHE B TERM
LOAN COMMITMENTS") and/or (y) Incremental Revolving Credit Commitments (the
"INCREMENTAL REVOLVING CREDIT COMMITMENT" and, together with the Incremental
Tranche B Term Loan Commitments, the "INCREMENTAL LOAN COMMITMENTS"), by an
aggregate amount not in excess of $200,000,000 in the aggregate and not less
than $25,000,000 individually (or such lesser amount which shall be approved by
the Administrative Agent or such lesser amount that shall constitute the
difference between $200,000,000 and all such Incremental Loan Commitments
obtained prior to such date), and integral multiples of $5,000,000 in excess of
that amount. Each such notice shall specify the date (each, an "INCREASED AMOUNT
DATE") on which the Borrower proposes that the Incremental Loan Commitments
shall be effective, which shall be a date not less than 10 Business Days after
the date on which such notice is delivered to the Administrative Agent; PROVIDED
that the Borrower shall first offer the Lenders, on a PRO RATA basis, the
opportunity to provide all of the Incremental Loan Commitments prior to offering
any other Person that is an eligible assignee pursuant to Section 14.6(b);
PROVIDED, FURTHER, that any Lender offered or approached to provide all or a
portion of the Incremental Loan Commitments may elect or decline, in its sole
discretion, to provide an Incremental Loan Commitment. Such Incremental Loan
Commitments shall become effective, as of such Increased Amount Date; PROVIDED
that (1) no Default or Event of Default shall



                                       -60-
<PAGE>

exist on such Increased Amount Date before or after giving effect to such
Incremental Loan Commitments, as applicable; (2) both before and after giving
effect to the making of any Series of Incremental Tranche B Term Loans or
Incremental Revolving Loans, each of the conditions set forth in Section 7 shall
be satisfied; (3) the Borrower and its Subsidiaries shall be in pro forma
(giving effect to the application of proceeds of any incremental loans)
compliance with the covenant set forth in Section 11 (without giving effect to
any waiver pursuant to clause (a) thereto or any application of clause (b)
thereto and regardless of whether or not the Revolving Credit Commitment has
been terminated) as of the last day of the most recently ended fiscal quarter
after giving effect to such Incremental Loan Commitments and any Investment to
be consummated in connection therewith; (4) the Incremental Loan Commitments
shall be effected pursuant to one or more Joinder Agreements executed and
delivered by the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, and each of which shall
be recorded in the Register and shall be subject to the requirements set forth
in Section 5.4(d); (5) the Borrower shall make any payments required pursuant to
Section 2.11 in connection with the Incremental Loan Commitments, as applicable;
and (6) the Borrower shall deliver or cause to be delivered any legal opinions
or other documents reasonably requested by the Administrative Agent in
connection with any such transaction. Any Incremental Tranche B Term Loans made
on an Increased Amount Date shall be designated, a separate series (a "SERIES")
of Incremental Tranche B Term Loans for all purposes of this Agreement.

          On any Increased Amount Date on which Incremental Revolving Loan
Commitments are effected, subject to the satisfaction of the foregoing terms and
conditions, (a) each of the Lenders with Revolving Credit Commitments shall
assign to each Lender with an Incremental Revolving Credit Commitment (each, an
"INCREMENTAL REVOLVING LOAN LENDER") and each of the Incremental Revolving Loan
Lenders shall purchase from each of the Lenders with Revolving Credit
Commitments, at the principal amount thereof (together with accrued interest),
such interests in the Revolving Credit Loans outstanding on such Increased
Amount Date as shall be necessary in order that, after giving effect to all such
assignments and purchases, such Revolving Credit Loans will be held by existing
Lenders with Revolving Credit Loans and Incremental Revolving Loan Lenders
ratably in accordance with their Revolving Credit Commitments after giving
effect to the addition of such Incremental Revolving Credit Commitments to the
Revolving Credit Commitments, (b) each Incremental Revolving Credit Commitment
shall be deemed for all purposes a Revolving Credit Commitment and each Loan
made thereunder (an "INCREMENTAL REVOLVING LOAN") shall be deemed, for all
purposes, a Revolving Credit Loan and (c) each Incremental Revolving Loan Lender
shall become a Lender with respect to the Incremental Revolving Loan Commitment
and all matters relating thereto.

          On any Increased Amount Date on which any Incremental Tranche B Term
Loan Commitments of any Series are effective, subject to the satisfaction of the
foregoing terms and conditions, (i) each Lender with an Incremental Tranche B
Term Loan Commitment (each, an "INCREMENTAL TRANCHE B LOAN LENDER") of any
Series shall make a Loan to the Borrower (an "INCREMENTAL TRANCHE B TERM LOAN")
in an amount equal to its Incremental Tranche B Term Loan Commitment of such
Series, and (ii) each Incremental Tranche B Term Loan Lender of any Series shall
become a Lender hereunder with respect to the Incremental Tranche B Term Loan
Commitment of such Series and the Incremental Tranche B Term Loans of such
Series made pursuant thereto.

                                       -61-
<PAGE>

          The terms and provisions of the Incremental Tranche B Term Loans and
Incremental Tranche B Term Loan Commitments of any Series shall be, except as
otherwise set forth herein or in the Joinder Agreement, identical to the Tranche
B Term Loans; provided, HOWEVER, that (i) the applicable Incremental Tranche B
Term Loan Maturity Date of each Series shall be no shorter than the final
maturity of the Revolving Credit Loans and the Tranche B Term Loans and (ii) the
rate of interest applicable to the Incremental Tranche B Term Loans of each
Series shall be determined by the Borrower and the applicable new Lenders and
shall be set forth in each applicable Joinder Agreement. The terms and
provisions of the Incremental Revolving Loans and Incremental Revolving Credit
Commitments shall be identical to the Revolving Credit Loans and the Revolving
Credit Commitments.

          Each Joinder Agreement may, without the consent of any other Lenders,
effect such amendments to this Agreement and the other Credit Documents as may
be necessary or appropriate, in the opinion of the Administrative Agent, to
effect the provision of this Section 2.14.

          SECTION 3. LETTERS OF CREDIT.

          3.1. LETTERS OF CREDIT.

          (a) Subject to and upon the terms and conditions herein set forth, at
any time and from time to time after the Closing Date and prior to the L/C
Maturity Date, the Borrower, may request that the Letter of Credit Issuer issue
for the account of the Borrower (i) a standby letter of credit or letters of
credit in Dollars, (ii) a sight trade letter of credit or letters of credit in
Dollars or (iii) for the account of the Borrower and for the benefit of any
creditor of the Borrower or its Subsidiaries located outside the United States,
a bank guarantee or bank guarantees (collectively, the "LETTERS OF CREDIT" and
each, a "LETTER OF CREDIT"), in each case in such form as may be approved by the
Letter of Credit Issuer in its reasonable discretion.

          (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) no Letter of Credit shall be
issued the Stated Amount of which, when added to the Letters of Credit
Outstanding at such time, would exceed the Letter of Credit Commitment then in
effect; (ii) no Letter of Credit shall be issued the Stated Amount of which
would cause the aggregate amount of the Lender's Revolving Credit Exposures at
such time to exceed the Revolving Credit Commitment then in effect; (iii) each
Letter of Credit shall have an expiration date occurring no later than one year
after the date of issuance thereof, unless otherwise agreed upon by the
Administrative Agent and the Letter of Credit Issuer, PROVIDED that in no event
shall such expiration date occur later than the L/C Maturity Date; (iv) each
Letter of Credit shall be denominated in Dollars or Euros, PROVIDED that the
aggregate Stated Amount of all Letters of Credit denominated in Euros shall not
exceed $30,000,000; (v) no Letter of Credit shall be issued if it would be
illegal under any applicable law for the beneficiary of the Letter of Credit to
have a Letter of Credit issued in its favor; (vi) no Letter of Credit shall be
issued by a Letter of Credit Issuer after it has received a written notice from
the Borrower or any Lender stating that a Default or Event of Default has
occurred and is continuing until such time as the Letter of Credit Issuer shall
have received a written notice of (x) rescission of such notice from the party
or parties originally delivering such notice or (y) the waiver of such Default
or Event of Default in accordance with the provisions of Section 14.1; and (vii)
no Letter of Credit shall be issued unless after giving effect thereto and to
all other issuances of Letters of Credit and borrowings of Revolving Loans and
Swingline Loans on such

                                       -62-
<PAGE>

date, the Intelsat Ltd. Notes Condition is satisfied. Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, the issuance of Letters of Credit for the account of the
Borrower shall be deemed a utilization of the Revolving Credit Commitments
allocated to the Borrower.

          (c) Upon at least one Business Day's prior written notice (or
telephonic notice promptly confirmed in writing) to the Administrative Agent and
the Letter of Credit Issuer (which notice the Administrative Agent shall
promptly transmit to each of the applicable Lenders), the Borrower shall have
the right, on any day, permanently to terminate or reduce the Letter of Credit
Commitment in whole or in part, PROVIDED that, after giving effect to such
termination or reduction, the Letters of Credit Outstanding shall not exceed the
Letter of Credit Commitment.

          (d) The parties hereto agree that, subject to the satisfaction of the
conditions precedent set forth in Section 6, the Existing Letters of Credit
shall be deemed Letters of Credit for all purposes under this Agreement, without
any further action by the Borrower.

          (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this SECTION 3.1, a
Letter of Credit Issuer shall be under no obligation to issue any Letter of
Credit if any Lender with a Revolving Credit Commitment is a Defaulting Lender
at such time, unless such Letter of Credit Issuer has entered into arrangement
reasonably satisfactory to it and the Borrower to eliminate such Letter of
Credit Issuer's risk with respect to the participation in Letters of Credit by
such Defaulting Lender (which may include, without limitation, cash
collateralizing such Defaulting Lender's Revolving Credit Commitment Percentage
of the Letter of Credit Outstandings).

          3.2. LETTER OF CREDIT REQUESTS.

          (a) Whenever the Borrower desires that a Letter of Credit be issued
for its account, it shall give the Administrative Agent and the Letter of Credit
Issuer at least five (or such lesser number as may be agreed upon by the
Administrative Agent and the Letter of Credit Issuer) Business Days' written
notice thereof. Each notice shall be executed by the Borrower and shall be in
the form of EXHIBIT H hereto (each a "LETTER OF CREDIT REQUEST"). The
Administrative Agent shall promptly transmit copies of each Letter of Credit
Request to each Lender.

          (b) The making of each Letter of Credit Request shall be deemed to be
a representation and warranty by the Borrower that the Letter of Credit may be
issued in accordance with, and will not violate the requirements of, Section
3.1(b).

          3.3. LETTER OF CREDIT PARTICIPATIONS.

          (a) Immediately upon the issuance by the Letter of Credit Issuer of
any Letter of Credit, the Letter of Credit Issuer shall be deemed to have sold
and transferred to each other Lender that has a Revolving Credit Commitment
(each such other Lender, in its capacity under this Section 3.3, an "L/C
PARTICIPANT"), and each such L/C Participant shall be deemed irrevocably and
unconditionally to have purchased and received from the Letter of Credit Issuer,
without recourse or warranty, an undivided interest and participation (each an
"L/C PARTICIPATION"), to the extent of such L/C Participant's Revolving Credit
Commitment Percentage in such Letter of Credit, each substitute letter of
credit, each drawing made thereunder and the obligations of the Borrower under
this Agreement with respect thereto, and any security therefor or guaranty
per-

                                       -63-
<PAGE>

taining thereto (although Letter of Credit Fees will be paid directly to the
Administrative Agent for the ratable account of the L/C Participants as provided
in Section 4.1(b) and the L/C Participants shall have no right to receive any
portion of any Fronting Fees).

          (b) In determining whether to pay under any Letter of Credit, the
relevant Letter of Credit Issuer shall have no obligation relative to the L/C
Participants other than to confirm that any documents required to be delivered
under such Letter of Credit have been delivered and that they appear to comply
on their face with the requirements of such Letter of Credit. Any action taken
or omitted to be taken by the relevant Letter of Credit Issuer under or in
connection with any Letter of Credit issued by it, if taken or omitted in the
absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct, shall not create for the
Letter of Credit Issuer any resulting liability.

          (c) In the event that the Letter of Credit Issuer makes any payment
under any Letter of Credit issued by it and the Borrower shall not have repaid
such amount in full to the respective Letter of Credit Issuer pursuant to
Section 3.4(a), the Letter of Credit Issuer shall promptly notify the
Administrative Agent and each applicable L/C Participant of such failure, and
each such L/C Participant shall promptly and unconditionally pay to the
Administrative Agent for the account of the Letter of Credit Issuer, the amount
of such L/C Participant's Revolving Credit Commitment Percentage of such
unreimbursed payment in Dollars or Euros, as the case may be, and in immediately
available funds; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that no L/C Participant shall be obligated
to pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of the respective Letter of
Credit Issuer its Revolving Credit Commitment Percentage of such unreimbursed
amount arising from any wrongful payment made by the Letter of Credit Issuer
under a Letter of Credit as a result of acts or omissions constituting willful
misconduct or gross negligence on the part of the Letter of Credit Issuer. If
the Letter of Credit Issuer so notifies, prior to 11:00 a.m. (New York City
time) on any Business Day, any L/C Participant required to fund a payment under
a Letter of Credit, such L/C Participant shall make available to the
Administrative Agent for the account of the Letter of Credit Issuer such L/C
Participant's Revolving Credit Commitment Percentage of the amount of such
payment on such Business Day in immediately available funds. If and to the
extent such L/C Participant shall not have so made its Revolving Credit
Commitment Percentage of the amount of such payment available to the
Administrative Agent for the account of the Letter of Credit Issuer, such L/C
Participant agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of the
Letter of Credit Issuer, forthwith on demand, such amount, together with
interest thereon for each day from such date until the date such amount is paid
to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Letter of Credit Issuer at
the Federal Funds Effective Rate. The failure of any L/C Participant to make
available to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Letter of Credit
Issuer its Revolving Credit Commitment Percentage of any payment under any
Letter of Credit shall not relieve any other L/C Participant of its obligation
hereunder to make available to the Administrative Agent for the account of the
Letter of Credit Issuer its Revolving Credit Commitment Percentage of any
payment under such Letter of Credit on the date required, as specified above,
but no L/C Participant shall be responsible for the failure of any other L/C
Participant to make available to the Administrative Agent such other L/C
Participant's Revolving Credit Commitment Percentage of any such payment.

          (d) Whenever the Letter of Credit Issuer receives a payment in respect
of an unpaid reimbursement obligation as to which the Administrative Agent has
received for the ac-

                                       -64-
<PAGE>

count of the Letter of Credit Issuer any payments from the L/C Participants
pursuant to paragraph (c) above, the Letter of Credit Issuer shall pay to the
Administrative Agent and the Administrative Agent shall promptly pay to each L/C
Participant that has paid its Revolving Credit Commitment Percentage of such
reimbursement obligation, in Dollars or Euros, as the case may be, and in
immediately available funds, an amount equal to such L/C Participant's share
(based upon the proportionate aggregate amount originally funded by such L/C
Participant to the aggregate amount funded by all L/C Participants) of the
principal amount of such reimbursement obligation and interest thereon accruing
after the purchase of the respective L/C Participations.

          (e) The obligations of the L/C Participants to make payments to the
Administrative Agent for the account of a Letter of Credit Issuer with respect
to Letters of Credit shall be irrevocable and not subject to counterclaim,
set-off or other defense or any other qualification or exception whatsoever and
shall be made in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement
under all circumstances, including under any of the following circumstances:

          (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of this Agreement or any of
     the other Credit Documents;

          (ii) the existence of any claim, set-off, defense or other right that
     the Borrower may have at any time against a beneficiary named in a Letter
     of Credit, any transferee of any Letter of Credit (or any Person for whom
     any such transferee may be acting), the Administrative Agent, the Letter of
     Credit Issuer, any Lender or other Person, whether in connection with this
     Agreement, any Letter of Credit, the transactions contemplated herein or
     any unrelated transactions (including any underlying transaction between
     the Borrower and the beneficiary named in any such Letter of Credit);

          (iii) any draft, certificate or any other document presented under any
     Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent, invalid or insufficient
     in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any
     respect;

          (iv) the surrender or impairment of any security for the performance
     or observance of any of the terms of any of the Credit Documents; or

          (v) the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default;

PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that no L/C Participant shall be obligated to pay to the
Administrative Agent for the account of the Letter of Credit Issuer its
Revolving Credit Commitment Percentage of any unreimbursed amount arising from
any wrongful payment made by the Letter of Credit Issuer under a Letter of
Credit as a result of acts or omissions constituting willful misconduct or gross
negligence on the part of the Letter of Credit Issuer.

          3.4. AGREEMENT TO REPAY LETTER OF CREDIT DRAWINGS.

          (a) The Borrower hereby agrees to reimburse the relevant Letter of
Credit Issuer, by making payment in Dollars or Euros, as the case may be, to the
Administrative Agent (in the case of reimbursement made by the Borrower) in
immediately available funds for any payment or disbursement made by the Letter
of Credit Issuer under any Letter of Credit (each such

                                       -65-
<PAGE>

amount so paid until reimbursed, an "UNPAID DRAWING") immediately after, and in
any event on the date of, such payment, with interest on the amount so paid or
disbursed by the Letter of Credit Issuer, to the extent not reimbursed prior to
5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the date of such payment or disbursement, from
and including the date paid or disbursed to but excluding the date the Letter of
Credit Issuer is reimbursed therefor at a rate PER ANNUM that shall at all times
be the Applicable ABR Margin plus the ABR Rate as in effect from time to time,
PROVIDED that, notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the
contrary, (i) unless the Borrower shall have notified the Administrative Agent
and the relevant Letter of Credit Issuer prior to 10:00 a.m. (New York City
time) on the date of such drawing that the Borrower intends to reimburse the
relevant Letter of Credit Issuer for the amount of such drawing with funds other
than the proceeds of Loans, the Borrower shall be deemed to have given a Notice
of Borrowing requesting that, with respect to Letters of Credit, that the
Lenders with Revolving Credit Commitments make Revolving Credit Loans (which
shall be ABR Loans) and (ii) the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each
relevant L/C Participant of such drawing and the amount of its Revolving Credit
Loan to be made in respect thereof, and each L/C Participant shall be
irrevocably obligated to make a Revolving Credit Loan to the Borrower in the
manner deemed to have been requested in the amount of its Revolving Credit
Commitment Percentage of the applicable Unpaid Drawing by 12:00 noon (New York
City time) on such Business Day by making the amount of such Revolving Credit
Loan available to the Administrative Agent. Such Revolving Credit Loans shall be
made without regard to the Minimum Borrowing Amount. The Administrative Agent
shall use the proceeds of such Revolving Credit Loans solely for purpose of
reimbursing the Letter of Credit Issuer for the related Unpaid Drawing.

          (b) The obligations of the Borrower under this Section 3.4 to
reimburse the Letter of Credit Issuer with respect to Unpaid Drawings
(including, in each case, interest thereon) shall be absolute and unconditional
under any and all circumstances and irrespective of any set-off, counterclaim or
defense to payment that the Borrower or any other Person may have or have had
against the Letter of Credit Issuer, the Administrative Agent or any Lender
(including in its capacity as an L/C Participant), including any defense based
upon the failure of any drawing under a Letter of Credit (each a "DRAWING") to
conform to the terms of the Letter of Credit or any non-application or
misapplication by the beneficiary of the proceeds of such Drawing, PROVIDED that
the Borrower shall not be obligated to reimburse the Letter of Credit Issuer for
any wrongful payment made by the Letter of Credit Issuer under the Letter of
Credit issued by it as a result of acts or omissions constituting willful
misconduct or gross negligence on the part of the Letter of Credit Issuer.

          3.5. INCREASED COSTS. If, after the Closing Date, the adoption of any
applicable law, rule or regulation, or any change therein, or any change in the
interpretation or administration thereof by any Governmental Authority, central
bank or comparable agency charged with the interpretation or administration
thereof, or actual compliance by the Letter of Credit Issuer or any L/C
Participant with any request or directive made or adopted after the Closing Date
(whether or not having the force of law), by any such authority, central bank or
comparable agency shall either (a) impose, modify or make applicable any
reserve, deposit, capital adequacy or similar requirement against letters of
credit issued by the Letter of Credit Issuer, or any L/C Participant's L/C
Participation therein, or (b) impose on the Letter of Credit Issuer or any L/C
Participant any other conditions affecting its obligations under this Agreement
in respect of Let-

                                       -66-
<PAGE>

ters of Credit or L/C Participations therein or any Letter of Credit or such L/C
Participant's L/C Participation therein, and the result of any of the foregoing
is to increase the cost to the Letter of Credit Issuer or such L/C Participant
of issuing, maintaining or participating in any Letter of Credit, or to reduce
the amount of any sum received or receivable by the Letter of Credit Issuer or
such L/C Participant hereunder (other than any such increase or reduction
attributable to taxes) in respect of Letters of Credit or L/C Participations
therein, then, promptly after receipt of written demand to the Borrower by the
Letter of Credit Issuer or such L/C Participant, as the case may be (a copy of
which notice shall be sent by the Letter of Credit Issuer or such L/C
Participant to the Administrative Agent (with respect to Letter of Credit issued
on account of the Borrower)), the Borrower shall pay to the Letter of Credit
Issuer or such L/C Participant such additional amount or amounts as will
compensate the Letter of Credit Issuer or such L/C Participant for such
increased cost or reduction, it being understood and agreed, however, that the
Letter of Credit Issuer or a L/C Participant shall not be entitled to such
compensation as a result of such Person's compliance with, or pursuant to any
request or directive to comply with, any such law, rule or regulation as in
effect on the Closing Date. A certificate submitted to the Borrower by the
relevant Letter of Credit Issuer or a L/C Participant, as the case may be (a
copy of which certificate shall be sent by the Letter of Credit Issuer or such
L/C Participant to the Administrative Agent (with respect to Letters of Credit
issued on account of the Borrower)), setting forth in reasonable detail the
basis for the determination of such additional amount or amounts necessary to
compensate the Letter of Credit Issuer or such L/C Participant as aforesaid
shall be conclusive and binding on the Borrower absent clearly demonstrable
error.

          3.6. SUCCESSOR LETTER OF CREDIT ISSUER. A Letter of Credit Issuer may
resign as Letter of Credit Issuer upon 60 days' prior written notice to the
Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the Borrower. If the Letter of Credit
Issuer shall resign as Letter of Credit Issuer under this Agreement, then the
Borrower shall appoint from among the Lenders with Revolving Credit Commitments
a successor issuer of Letters of Credit, whereupon such successor issuer shall
succeed to the rights, powers and duties of the Letter of Credit Issuer, and the
term "Letter of Credit Issuer" shall mean such successor issuer effective upon
such appointment. At the time such resignation shall become effective, the
Borrower shall pay to the resigning Letter of Credit Issuer all accrued and
unpaid fees pursuant to Sections 4.1(c) and (e). The acceptance of any
appointment as the Letter of Credit Issuer hereunder by a successor Lender shall
be evidenced by an agreement entered into by such successor, in a form
satisfactory to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent and, from and after
the effective date of such agreement, such successor Lender shall have all the
rights and obligations of the previous Letter of Credit Issuer under this
Agreement and the other Credit Documents. At the time such resignation shall
become effective, the Borrower shall pay to the resigning Letter of Credit
Issuer all accrued and unpaid fees pursuant to Sections 4.1(d) and (e). After
the resignation of the Letter of Credit Issuer hereunder, the resigning Letter
of Credit Issuer shall remain a party hereto and shall continue to have all the
rights and obligations of a Letter of Credit Issuer under this Agreement and the
other Credit Documents with respect to Letters of Credit issued by it prior to
such resignation, but shall not be required to issue additional Letters of
Credit. After any retiring Letter of Credit Issuer's resignation as Letter of
Credit Issuer, the provisions of this Agreement relating to the Letter of Credit
Issuer shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken
by it (a) while it was Letter of Credit Issuer under this Agreement or (b) at
any time with respect to Letters of Credit issued by such Letter of Credit
Issuer.

          4.1. FEES.

          (a) (i) The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent in
Dollars, for the account of each Lender having a Revolving Credit Commitment (in

of Credit Exposure, a fee in respect of each Letter of Credit (the "LETTER OF

Letter of Credit to but excluding the termination date of such Letter of Credit
computed at the PER ANNUM rate for each day equal to the Applicable LIBOR Margin
for Revolving Credit Loans minus 0.125% PER ANNUM on the average daily Stated
Amount of such Letter of Credit. Such Letter of Credit Fees shall be due and
payable quarterly in arrears on the last day of each March, June, September and
December and on the date upon which the Total Revolving Credit Commitment
terminates and the Letters of Credit Outstanding shall have been reduced to
zero.

          (c) The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent in Dollars
for the account of the Letter of Credit Issuer a fee in respect of each Letter
of Credit issued by it (the "FRONTING FEE"), for the period from and including
the date of issuance of such Letter of Credit to but excluding the termination
date of such Letter of Credit, computed at the rate for each day equal to 0.125%
PER ANNUM on the average daily Stated Amount of such Letter of Credit. Such
Fronting Fees shall be due and payable quarterly in arrears on the last day of
each March, June, September and December and on the date upon which the Total
Revolving Credit Commitment terminates and the Letters of Credit Outstanding

in Dollars upon each issuance of, drawing under, and/or amendment of, a Letter
of Credit issued by it such amount as the Letter of Credit Issuer and the
Borrower shall have agreed upon for issuances of, drawings under or amendments
of, letters of credit issued by it.

          4.2. VOLUNTARY REDUCTION OF REVOLVING CREDIT COMMITMENTS. Upon at
least one Business Day's prior written notice (or telephonic notice promptly
confirmed in writing) to the Administrative Agent at the Administrative Agent's
Office (which notice the Administrative Agent shall promptly transmit to each of
the Lenders), the Borrower (on behalf of itself) shall

                                       -68-
<PAGE>

have the right, without premium or penalty, on any day, permanently to terminate
or reduce the Revolving Credit Commitments in whole or in part, PROVIDED that
(a) any such reduction shall apply proportionately and permanently to reduce the
Revolving Credit Commitment of each of the Lenders, (b) any partial reduction
pursuant to this Section 4.2 shall be in the amount of at least $5,000,000 and
(c) after giving effect to such termination or reduction and to any prepayments
of the Loans made on the date thereof in accordance with this Agreement, the
aggregate amount of the Lenders' Revolving Credit Exposures shall not exceed the
Total Revolving Credit Commitment.

          4.3. MANDATORY TERMINATION OF COMMITMENTS.

          (a) (i) [INTENTIONALLY OMITTED]

          (d) The Incremental Tranche B Term Loan Commitment for any Series
shall terminate at 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the Increased Amount Date
for such Series.

          (e) If any prepayment of Term Loans would otherwise be required
pursuant to Section 5.2(a) but cannot be made because there are no Term Loans
outstanding, or because the amount of the required prepayment exceeds the
outstanding amount of Term Loans, then, on the date that such prepayment is
required, an aggregate amount equal to the amount of the required prepayment, or
the excess of such amount over the outstanding amount of Tranche B Term Loans,
as the case may be, shall be applied by the Borrower, first, to repay the
outstanding principal amount of Swingline Loans, second, after all Swingline
Loans have been paid in full, Revolving Credit Loans (without a reduction of the
Revolving Credit Commitment) and third, after all Revolving Credit Loans have
been paid in full, to cash collateralize Letters of Credit.

          SECTION 5. PAYMENTS.

          5.1. VOLUNTARY PREPAYMENTS. The Borrower shall have the right to
prepay Term Loans, Revolving Credit Loans and Swingline Loans, in each case,
without premium or penalty, in whole or in part from time to time on the
following terms and conditions: (a) the Borrower shall give the Administrative
Agent and at the Administrative Agent's Office written notice (or telephonic
notice promptly confirmed in writing) of its intent to make such prepayment, the
amount of such prepayment and (in the case of LIBOR Loans) the specific
Borrowing(s) pursuant to which made, which notice shall be given by the Borrower
no later than (i) in the case of Term Loans or Revolving Credit Loans, 10:00
a.m. (New York City time) one Business Day prior to, or (ii) in the case of
Swingline Loans, 10:00 a.m. (New York City time) on, the date of such prepayment
and shall promptly be transmitted by the Administrative Agent to each of the

                                       -69-
<PAGE>

Lenders or the Swingline Lender, as the case may be; (b) each partial prepayment
of any Borrowing of Term Loans or Revolving Credit Loans shall be in a multiple
of $100,000 and in an aggregate principal amount of at least $1,000,000 and each
partial prepayment of Swingline Loans shall be in a multiple of $10,000 and in
an aggregate principal amount of at least $100,000, PROVIDED that no partial
prepayment of LIBOR Term Loans or LIBOR Revolving Credit Loans made pursuant to
a single Borrowing shall reduce the outstanding LIBOR Term Loans or LIBOR
Revolving Credit Loans made pursuant to such Borrowing to an amount less than
the Minimum Borrowing Amount for LIBOR Term Loans or LIBOR Revolving Credit
Loans and (c) any prepayment of LIBOR Term Loans or LIBOR Revolving Credit Loans
pursuant to this Section 5.1 on any day other than the last day of an Interest
Period applicable thereto shall be subject to compliance by the Borrower with
the applicable provisions of Section 2.11. Each prepayment in respect of any
tranche of Term Loans pursuant to this Section 5.1 shall be applied to reduce
Repayment Amounts in such order as the Borrower may determine. At the Borrower's
election in connection with any prepayment pursuant to this Section 5.1, such
prepayment shall not be applied to any Term Loan or Revolving Credit Loan of a
Defaulting Lender.

          5.2. MANDATORY PREPAYMENTS.

          (a) TERM LOAN PREPAYMENTS. (i) On each occasion that a Prepayment
Event occurs, the Borrower shall, within one Business Day after the occurrence
of a Debt Incurrence Prepayment Event and within five Business Days after the
occurrence of any other Prepayment Event, prepay, in accordance with paragraph
(c) below, the principal amount of Term Loans in an amount equal to 100% of the
Net Cash Proceeds from such Prepayment Event.

          (ii) [INTENTIONALLY OMITTED].

          (iii) [INTENTIONALLY OMITTED].

          (iv) [INTENTIONALLY OMITTED].

          (b) REPAYMENT OF REVOLVING CREDIT LOANS. If on any date the aggregate
amount of the Lenders' Revolving Credit Exposures (all the foregoing,
collectively, the "AGGREGATE REVOLVING CREDIT OUTSTANDINGS") exceeds 100% of the
Total Revolving Credit Commitment as then in effect, the Borrower shall
forthwith repay on such date the principal amount of Swingline Loans and, after
all Swingline Loans have been paid in full, Revolving Credit Loans in an amount
equal to such excess. If, after giving effect to the prepayment of all
outstanding Swingline Loans and Revolving Credit Loans, the Aggregate Revolving
Credit Outstandings exceed the Total Revolving Credit Commitment then in effect,
the Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent an amount in cash equal to
such excess and the Administrative Agent shall hold such payment for the benefit
of the Lenders as security for the obligations of the Borrower hereunder
(including obligations in respect of Letters of Credit Outstanding) pursuant to
a cash collateral agreement to be entered into in form and substance
satisfactory to the Administrative Agent (which shall permit certain Investments
in Permitted Investments satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, until the
proceeds are applied to the secured obligations).

                                       -70-
<PAGE>

          (c) APPLICATION OF REPAYMENT AMOUNTS. Each prepayment of Term Loans
required by Section 5.2(a)(i) shall be applied to reduce the Repayment Amounts
in such order as the Borrower may determine up to an amount equal to the
aggregate amount of the applicable Repayment Amounts required to be made by the
Borrower pursuant to Section 2.5(b) and (c) during the two year period
immediately following the date of the prepayment (such amount being, the
"AMORTIZATION AMOUNT"), PROVIDED that to the extent that the amount of the
prepayment exceeds the Amortization Amount, such excess shall be applied ratably
to reduce the then remaining Repayment Amounts under such Credit Facility. With
respect to each such prepayment, the Borrower will, not later than the date
specified in Section 5.2(a) for making such prepayment, give the Administrative
Agent telephonic notice (promptly confirmed in writing) requesting that the
Administrative Agent provide notice of such prepayment to each Tranche B Term
Loan Lender.

          (d) APPLICATION TO TERM LOANS. With respect to each prepayment of
Tranche B Term Loans required by Section 5.2(a), the Borrower may designate the
Types of Loans that are to be prepaid and the specific Borrowing(s) pursuant to
which made, PROVIDED that LIBOR Term Loans made pursuant to a single Borrowing
shall reduce the outstanding Term Loans made pursuant to such Borrowing to an
amount less than the Minimum Borrowing Amount for LIBOR Loans such Borrowing
shall immediately be converted into ABR Loans. In the absence of a designation
by the Borrower as described in the preceding sentence, the Administrative Agent
shall, subject to the above, make such designation in its reasonable discretion
with a view, but no obligation, to minimize breakage costs owing under Section
2.11.

          (e) APPLICATION TO REVOLVING CREDIT LOANS. With respect to each
prepayment of Revolving Credit Loans required by Section 5.2(b), the Borrower
may designate (i) the Types of Loans that are to be prepaid and the specific
Borrowing(s) pursuant to which made and (ii) the Revolving Credit Loans to be
prepaid, PROVIDED that (w) LIBOR Revolving Credit Loans may be designated for
prepayment pursuant to this Section 5.2 only on the last day of an Interest
Period applicable thereto unless all LIBOR Loans with Interest Periods ending on
such date of required prepayment and all ABR Loans have been paid in full; (x)
if any prepayment by the Borrower of LIBOR Revolving Credit Loans made pursuant
to a single Borrowing shall reduce the outstanding Revolving Credit Loans made
pursuant to such Borrowing to an amount less than the Minimum Borrowing Amount
for LIBOR Revolving Credit Loans, such Borrowing shall immediately be converted
into ABR Loans; (y) each prepayment of any Loans made pursuant to a Borrowing
shall be applied PRO RATA among such Loans; and (z) notwithstanding the
provisions of the preceding clause (y), no prepayment made pursuant to Section
5.2(a) or Section 5.2(b) of Revolving Credit Loans shall be applied to the
Revolving Credit Loans of any Defaulting Lender. In the absence of a designation
by the Borrower as described in the preceding sentence, the Administrative Agent
shall, subject to the above, make such designation in its reasonable discretion
with a view, but no obligation, to minimize breakage costs owing under Section
2.11.

          (f) LIBOR INTEREST PERIODS. In lieu of making any payment pursuant to
this Section 5.2 in respect of any LIBOR Loan other than on the last day of the
Interest Period therefor so long as no Default or Event of Default shall have
occurred and be continuing, the Borrower at its option may deposit with the
Administrative Agent an amount equal to the amount of the LIBOR Loan to be
prepaid and such LIBOR Loan shall be repaid on the last day of the Inter-

                                       -71-
<PAGE>

est Period therefor in the required amount. Such deposit shall be held by the
Administrative Agent in a corporate time deposit account established on terms
reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, earning interest at the
then-customary rate for accounts of such type. Such deposit shall constitute
cash collateral for the Obligations, PROVIDED that the Borrower may at any time
direct that such deposit be applied to make the applicable payment required
pursuant to this Section 5.2.

          (g) [INTENTIONALLY OMITTED].

          (h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section
5.2 or elsewhere in this Agreement (including, without limitation, in Section
14.1), the Borrower shall have the option, in its sole discretion, to give the
Lenders with outstanding Term Loans the option to waive their PRO RATA share of
a mandatory repayment of Term Loans which is to be made pursuant to Section 5.2
(each such repayment, a "WAIVABLE MANDATORY REPAYMENT") upon the terms and
provisions set forth in this Section 5.2(i) except for Debt Incurrence
Prepayment Events for Indebtedness permitted to be incurred under Section
10.1(A)(o) or 10.1(A)(w). If the Borrower elects to exercise the option referred
to in the immediately preceding sentence, the Borrower shall give to the
Administrative Agent written notice of its intention to give the Lenders the
right to waive a Waivable Mandatory Repayment (including in such notice, the
aggregate amount of such proposed repayment) at least five Business Days prior
to the date of the proposed repayment, which notice the Administrative Agent
shall promptly forward to all Lenders with outstanding Term Loans (indicating in
such notice the amount of such repayment to be applied to each such Lender's
outstanding Term Loans). The Borrower's offer to permit the Lenders with
outstanding Term Loans to waive any such Waivable Mandatory Repayment may apply
to all or part of such repayment, PROVIDED that any offer to waive part of such
repayment must be made ratably to the Lenders with outstanding Term Loans on the
basis of their outstanding Term Loans. In the event that any such Lender with
outstanding Term Loans desires to waive its PRO RATA share of such Lender's
right to receive any such Waivable Mandatory Repayment in whole or in part, such
Lender shall so advise the Administrative Agent no later than 4:00 P.M. (New
York time) on the date which is two Business Days after the date of such notice
from the Administrative Agent (and the Administrative Agent shall promptly
thereafter notify the Borrower thereof), which notice shall also include the
amount such Lender desires to receive in respect of such repayment. If any
Lender with outstanding Term Loans does not reply to the Administrative Agent
within such two Business Day period, such Lender will be deemed not to have
waived any part of such repayment. If any Lender with outstanding Term Loans
does not specify an amount it wishes to receive, such Lender will be deemed to
have accepted 100% of its share of such repayment. In the event that any such
Lender waives all or part of its share of any such Waivable Mandatory Repayment,
the Borrower shall retain 100% of the amount so waived by such Lender.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained above, if one or more Lenders
with outstanding Term Loans waives its right to receive all or any part of any
Waivable Mandatory Repayment, but less than all the Lenders with outstanding
Term Loans waive in full their right to receive 100% of the total payment
otherwise required with respect to the Term Loans, then the amount actually
applied to the repayment of Term Loans of Lenders which have waived all or any
part of their right to receive 100% of such repayment, shall be applied to each
then outstanding Borrowing of Term Loans on a PRO RATA basis (so that each
Lender with outstanding Term Loans shall, after giving effect to the application
of the respective repayment,

                                       -72-
<PAGE>

maintain the same percentage (as determined for such Lender, but not the same
percentage that the other Lenders with outstanding Term Loans hold and not the
same percentage held by such Lender prior to repayment) of each Borrowing of
Term Loans which remains outstanding after giving effect to such application).
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, Lenders shall not have the right to
waive mandatory repayments under Section 5.2(a) except as set forth in this
Section 5.2(h).

          (i) If on any date on which Dollar Equivalents are determined pursuant
to Section 14.19(c), the Letter of Credit Outstandings with respect to Letters
of Credit denominated in Euros exceed $30,000,000, the Borrower shall, if such
excess is greater than or equal to $500,000, pay to the Administrative Agent at
the Payment Office on such date an amount of cash and/or Cash Equivalents equal
to the amount by which such Letter of Credit Outstandings exceed $30,000,000,
such cash and/or Cash Equivalents (i) to be held as security for all obligations
of the Borrower to the Lenders hereunder in a cash collateral account to be
established by the Administrative Agent on terms reasonably satisfactory to the
Administrative Agent and (ii) to be released to the Borrower from and after any
date on which Dollar Equivalents are determined pursuant to Section 14.19(c) and
on which the Letter of Credit Outstandings with respect to Letters of Credit
denominated in Euros are no longer in excess of $30,000,000.

          5.3. METHOD AND PLACE OF PAYMENT.

          (a) Except as otherwise specifically provided herein, all payments
under this Agreement shall be made by the Borrower, without set-off,
counterclaim or deduction of any kind, to the Administrative Agent for the
ratable account of the Lenders entitled thereto, the Letter of Credit Issuer or
the Swingline Lender, as the case may be, not later than 12:00 Noon (New York
City time) on the date when due and shall be made in immediately available funds
at the Administrative Agent's Office or at such other office as the
Administrative Agent shall specify for such purpose by notice to the Borrower,
it being understood that written or facsimile notice by the Borrower to the
Administrative Agent to make a payment from the funds in the Borrower's account
at the Administrative Agent's Office shall constitute the making of such payment
to the extent of such funds held in such account. All payments under each Credit
Document (whether of principal, interest or otherwise) shall be made in Dollars.
The Administrative Agent will thereafter cause to be distributed on the same day
(if payment was actually received by the Administrative Agent prior to 2:00 p.m.
(New York City time) on such day) like funds relating to the payment of
principal or interest or Fees ratably to the Lenders entitled thereto.

          (b) Any payments under this Agreement that are made later than 2:00
p.m. (New York City time) shall be deemed to have been made on the next
succeeding Business Day. Whenever any payment to be made hereunder shall be
stated to be due on a day that is not a Business Day, the due date thereof shall
be extended to the next succeeding Business Day and, with respect to payments of
principal, interest shall be payable during such extension at the applicable
rate in effect immediately prior to such extension.

          5.4. NET PAYMENTS.

          (a) Any and all payments made by or on behalf of the Borrower or any
Guarantor under this Agreement or any other Credit Document shall be made free
and clear of, and

                                       -73-
<PAGE>

without deduction or withholding for or on account of, any Indemnified Taxes;
PROVIDED that if Borrower or any Guarantor shall be required by law to deduct or
withhold any Indemnified Taxes from such payments, then (i) the sum payable
shall be increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions and
withholdings (including deductions or withholdings applicable to additional sums
payable under this Section 5.4) the Administrative Agent or any Lender, as the
case may be, receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no
such deductions or withholdings been made, (ii) the Borrower or any Guarantor
shall make such deductions or withholdings and (iii) the Borrower or any
Guarantor shall pay the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant
Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law. Whenever any
Indemnified Taxes are payable by the Borrower, as promptly as possible
thereafter, the Borrower shall send to the Administrative Agent for its own
account or for the account of such Lender, as the case may be, a certified copy
of an original official receipt (or other evidence acceptable to such Lender,
acting reasonably) received by the Borrower showing payment thereof.

          (b) Borrower shall pay and shall indemnify and hold harmless the
Administrative Agent and each Lender (whether or not such Other Taxes were
correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority)
with regard to any Other Taxes.

          (c) Borrower shall indemnify and hold harmless the Administrative
Agent and each Lender within 15 Business Days after written demand therefor, for
the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes imposed on the Administrative Agent or
such Lender as the case may be, on or with respect to any payment by or on
account of any obligation of the Borrower or any Guarantor hereunder or under
any other Credit Document (including Indemnified Taxes imposed or asserted on or
attributable to amounts payable under this Section 5.4) and any reasonable
expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such
Indemnified Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant
Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or
liability delivered to the Borrower by a Lender or by the Administrative Agent
on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender shall be conclusive absent manifest
error.

          (d) A Foreign Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or
reduction in a withholding tax imposed under the laws of Bermuda with respect to
payments under this Agreement or any other Credit Document shall deliver to the
Borrower and the Administrative Agent, at the time or times prescribed by
applicable law and as reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative
Agent such properly completed and executed documentation as will permit such
payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate, PROVIDED that such
Lender is legally entitled to complete, execute and deliver such documentation.
To the extent it is legally entitled to do so, each Lender agrees to use
reasonable efforts (consistent with legal and regulatory restrictions and
subject to overall policy considerations of such Lender) to file or deliver to
the Borrower and the Administrative Agent any certificate or document, as
reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, that may be
necessary to establish any available exemption from, or reduction in the amount
of, any withholding taxes imposed by a jurisdiction other than Bermuda;
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that a Lender shall not be required to file or deliver any
such certificate or document if in such Lender's reasonable judgment such
completion, execution or delivery would be disadvantageous to such Lender or
would subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost.

                                       -74-
<PAGE>

          (e) If the Borrower determines in good faith that a reasonable basis
exists for contesting any taxes for which indemnification has been demanded
hereunder, the relevant Lender or the Administrative Agent, as applicable, shall
cooperate with the Borrower in challenging such taxes at the Borrower's expense
if so requested by the Borrower. If any Lender or the Administrative Agent, as
applicable, receives a refund of a tax for which a payment has been made by the
Borrower pursuant to this Agreement (or reduction of, or credit against its tax
liabilities in lieu of a refund), which refund, reduction or credit in the good
faith judgment of such Lender or Administrative Agent, as the case may be, is
attributable to such payment made by the Borrower, then the Lender or the
Administrative Agent, as the case may be, shall reimburse the Borrower for such
amount (together with any interest received thereon) as the Lender or
Administrative Agent, as the case may be, determines to be the proportion of the
refund, reduction or credit as will leave it, after such reimbursement, in no
better or worse position (taking into account expenses or any taxes imposed on
the refund) than it would have been in if the payment had not been required. A
Lender or Administrative Agent shall claim any refund, reduction or credit that
it determines is available to it, unless it concludes in its reasonable
discretion that it would be adversely affected by making such a claim. Neither
the Lender nor the Administrative Agent shall be obliged to disclose any
information regarding its tax affairs or computations to the Borrower in
connection with this paragraph (e) or any other provision of this Section 5.4.

          (f) The agreements in this Section 5.4 shall survive the termination
of this Agreement and the payment of the Loans and all other amounts payable
hereunder.

          5.5. COMPUTATIONS OF INTEREST AND FEES.

          (a) Interest on LIBOR Loans and, except as provided in the next
succeeding sentence, ABR Loans shall be calculated on the basis of a 360-day
year for the actual days elapsed. Interest on ABR Loans in respect of which the
rate of interest is calculated on the basis of the Prime Rate and interest on
overdue interest shall be calculated on the basis of a 365- (or 366-, as the
case may be) day year for the actual days elapsed.

          (b) Fees and Letters of Credit Outstanding shall be calculated on the
basis of a 365- (or 366-, as the case may be) day year for the actual days
elapsed.

          5.6. LIMIT ON RATE OF INTEREST.

          (a) NO PAYMENT SHALL EXCEED LAWFUL RATE. Notwithstanding any other
term of this Agreement, the Borrower shall not be obliged to pay any interest or
other amounts under or in connection with this Agreement in excess of the amount
or rate permitted under or consistent with any applicable law, rule or
regulation.

          (b) PAYMENT AT HIGHEST LAWFUL RATE. If the Borrower is not obliged to
make a payment which it would otherwise be required to make, as a result of
Section 5.6(a), the Borrower shall make such payment to the maximum extent
permitted by or consistent with applicable laws, rules and regulations.

          (c) ADJUSTMENT IF ANY PAYMENT EXCEEDS LAWFUL RATE. If any provision of
this Agreement or any of the other Credit Documents would obligate the Borrower
to make any

                                       -75-
<PAGE>

payment of interest or other amount payable to any Lender in an amount or
calculated at a rate which would be prohibited by any applicable law, rule or
regulation, then notwithstanding such provision, such amount or rate shall be
deemed to have been adjusted with retroactive effect to the maximum amount or
rate of interest, as the case may be, as would not be so prohibited by law, such
adjustment to be effected, to the extent necessary, by reducing the amount or
rate of interest required to be paid by the Borrower to the affected Lender
under Section 2.8.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, and after giving effect to all adjustments
contemplated thereby, if any Lender shall have received from the Borrower an
amount in excess of the maximum permitted by any applicable law, rule or
regulation, then the Borrower shall be entitled, by notice in writing to the
Administrative Agent to obtain reimbursement from that Lender in an amount equal
to such excess, and pending such reimbursement, such amount shall be deemed to
be an amount payable by that Lender to the Borrower.

          SECTION 6. CONDITIONS PRECEDENT TO INITIAL BORROWING ON THE CLOSING
DATE. The obligation of each Lender and, if applicable, each Letter of Credit
Issuer to fund the Loans and issue the Letters of Credit requested to be made or
issued by it on the Closing Date shall be subject to the prior or concurrent
satisfaction of each of the conditions precedent set forth in this Section 6.

          6.1. CONSUMMATION OF THE ACQUISITION. All conditions precedent to the
Acquisition shall be satisfied in accordance with the Acquisition Agreement and

contemporaneously with the effectiveness of this Agreement and the initial
funding of the Loans hereunder, and no material provision or condition of the
Acquisition Agreement shall have been waived, amended, supplemented or otherwise
modified in a manner that is material and adverse to the Lead Arrangers or the
Lenders without the prior written consent of the Lead Arrangers, which shall not
be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

any other agreements relating thereto) and (B) in the case of the Borrower, the

as of the date of such Credit Event (except where such representations and
warranties expressly relate to an earlier date, in which case such
representations and warranties shall have been true and correct in all material
respects as of such earlier date).

          7.2. NOTICE OF BORROWING; LETTER OF CREDIT REQUEST.

          (a) Prior to the making of each Term Loan, each Revolving Credit Loan

the applicable conditions specified above exist as of that time.

          SECTION 8. REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND AGREEMENTS.

          In order to induce the Lenders to enter into this Agreement, to make
the Loans and issue or participate in Letters of Credit as provided for herein,
Holdings and the Borrower make the following representations and warranties to,
and agreements with, the Lenders, all of which shall survive the execution and
delivery of this Agreement and the making of the Loans and the issuance of the
Letters of Credit:

          8.1. CORPORATE STATUS. Each of Holdings, the Borrower and each
Material Subsidiary (a) is a duly organized and validly existing corporation or
other entity in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its
organization and has the corporate or other organizational power and authority
to own its property and assets and to transact the business in which it is
engaged and (b) has duly qualified and is authorized to do business and is in
good standing in all jurisdictions where it is required to be so qualified,
except where the failure to be so qualified could not reasonably be expected to
result in a Material Adverse Effect.

          8.2. CORPORATE POWER AND AUTHORITY. Each Credit Party has the
corporate or other organizational power and authority to execute, deliver and
carry out the terms and provisions of the Credit Documents to which it is a
party and has taken all necessary corporate or other organizational action to
authorize the execution, delivery and performance of the Credit Documents to
which it is a party. Each Credit Party has duly executed and delivered each
Credit Document to which it is a party and each such Credit Document which is
currently in effect constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of such
Credit Party enforceable in accordance with its terms, except as the
enforceability thereof may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency or similar laws
affecting creditors' rights generally and subject to general principles of
equity.

          8.3. NO VIOLATION. Neither the execution, delivery or performance by
any Credit Party of the Credit Documents to which it is a party and which is
currently in effect nor compliance with the terms and provisions thereof nor the
consummation of the Acquisition and the other transactions contemplated hereby
or thereby will (a) contravene any applicable provision of any material law,
statute, rule, regulation, order, writ, injunction or decree of any court or
governmental instrumentality, (b) result in any breach of any of the terms,
covenants, conditions

                                       -79-
<PAGE>

or provisions of, or constitute a default under, or result in the creation or
imposition of (or the obligation to create or impose) any Lien upon any of the
property or assets of the Borrower or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries (other
than Liens created under the Credit Documents) pursuant to, the terms of any
material indenture (including the Senior Note Indentures), loan agreement, lease
agreement, mortgage, deed of trust, agreement or other material instrument to

     is delivered to the Lenders), exhibits to any registration statement and,
     if applicable, any registration statements on Form S-8) and copies of all
     financial statements, proxy statements, notices and reports that Holdings,
     the Borrower or any of the Subsidiaries shall send to the holders of any
     publicly issued debt of Holdings, the Borrower and/or any of the
     Subsidiaries (including any Senior Notes (whether publicly issued or not))
     in their capacity as such holders (in each case to the extent not
     theretofore delivered to the Lenders pursuant to this Agreement) and, with
     reasonable promptness, such other information (financial or otherwise) as
     the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of the Required
     Lenders may reasonably request in writing from time to time; PROVIDED that
     Holdings and the Borrower shall not be required to furnish any such reports
     and other materials to the Administrative Agent or any Lender to the extent
     the same is publicly available on the website of Intelsat, Ltd., Holdings
     or the Borrower or through the EDGAR system.

          (h)  PRO FORMA ADJUSTMENT CERTIFICATE. Not later than the consummation
     of the acquisition of any Acquired Entity or Business by the Borrower or
     any Restricted Subsidiary for which there shall be a Pro Forma Adjustment
     or not later than any date on which financial statements are delivered with
     respect to any four-quarter period in which a Pro Forma Adjustment is made
     as a result of the consummation of the acquisition of any Acquired Entity
     or Business by the Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary for which there
     shall be a Pro Forma Adjustment, a certificate of an Authorized Officer of
     the Borrower setting forth the amount of such Pro Forma Adjustment and, in
     reasonable detail, the calculations and basis therefor.

          (i)  FCC REPORTS. Promptly upon their becoming available, copies of
     any and all periodic or special reports filed by Holdings, the Borrower or
     any of its Restricted Subsidiaries with the FCC or with any other Federal,
     state or local governmental authority, if such reports indicate any
     material adverse change in the business, operations, affairs or condition
     of the Borrower or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, and copies of any
     and all notices and other communications from the FCC or from any other
     Federal, state or local governmental authority with respect to Holdings,
     the Borrower, any of its Subsidiaries or any Satellite relating to any
     matter that could reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse
     Effect.

          (j)  SATELLITE HEALTH REPORT. No less than annually with respect to
     each In-Orbit Satellite that has a net book value exceeding $50,000,000,
     and upon the occurrence of an Event of Default at any time upon the
     reasonable request of the Administrative Agent, (i) with respect to any one
     or more In-Orbit Satellites operated by the Borrower or

                                       -88-
<PAGE>

     any of its Subsidiaries, a Satellite Health Report and (ii) with respect to
     any In-Orbit Satellite that is operated by any Person other than the
     Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, any satellite health reports received
     by the Borrower from such Person, it being understood that to the extent
     that any such Satellite Health Report or other satellite health report
     contains any forward looking statements, estimates or projections, such
     statements, estimates or projections are subject to significant
     uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond the Borrower's or
     any of its Subsidiaries' control, and no assurance can be given that such
     forward looking statements, estimates or projections will be realized, and
     PROVIDED that nothing in this clause (j) shall require the Borrower to
     deliver any information to the Administrative Agent or any Lender to the
     extent delivery of such information is restricted by applicable law or
     regulation.

          9.2. BOOKS, RECORDS AND INSPECTIONS. Holdings and the Borrower will,
and the Borrower will cause each of the Subsidiaries to, permit officers and
designated representatives of the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders
to visit and inspect any of the properties or assets Holdings, the Borrower and
any such Subsidiary in whomsoever's possession to the extent that it is within
such party's control to permit such inspection, and to examine the books and
records of Holdings, the Borrower and any such Subsidiary and discuss the
affairs, finances and accounts of Holdings, the Borrower and of any such
Subsidiary with, and be advised as to the same by, its and their officers and
independent accountants, all at such reasonable times and intervals and to such
reasonable extent as the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders may
desire; PROVIDED that so long as no Default or Event of Default is then in
existence, the Borrower and any Credit Party shall have the right to participate
in any discussions of the Agents or the Lenders with any independent accountants
of Holdings or the Borrower.

          9.3. MAINTENANCE OF INSURANCE.

          (a)  The Borrower will, and the Borrower will cause each of its
Restricted Subsidiaries to, obtain, maintain and keep in full force and effect
at all times (i) with respect to each Satellite procured by the Borrower or any
of its Restricted Subsidiaries for which the risk of loss passes to the Borrower
or such Restricted Subsidiary at or before launch, and for which launch
insurance or commitments with respect thereto are not in place as of the Closing
Date, launch insurance with respect to each such Satellite covering the launch
of such Satellite and a period of time thereafter, but only to the extent, if at
all, and on such terms (including coverage period, exclusions, limitations on
coverage, co-insurance, deductibles and coverage amount) as is determined by the
Borrower to be in the best interests of the Borrower, (ii) with respect to each
Satellite it currently owns or for which it has risk of loss (or, if the entire
Satellite is not owned, the portion it owns or for which it has risk of loss),
other than any Excluded Satellite, In-Orbit Insurance and (iii) at all times
subsequent to the coverage period of the launch insurance described in clause
(i) above, if any, or if launch insurance is not procured, at all times
subsequent to the initial completion of in-orbit testing, in each case with
respect to each Satellite it then owns or for which it has risk of loss (or
portion, as applicable), other than any Excluded Satellite, In-Orbit Insurance;
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that at any time with respect to a Satellite that is not an
Excluded Satellite, none of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries shall be
required to maintain In-Orbit Insurance in excess of 33% of the aggregate net
book value of all in-orbit Satellites (and portions it owns or for which it has
risk of loss) insured (it being understood that any Satellite (or

                                       -89-
<PAGE>

portion, as applicable) protected by In-Orbit Contingency Protection shall be
deemed to be insured for a percentage of its net book value as set forth in the
definition of "In-Orbit Contingency Protection"). In the event that the
expiration and non-renewal of In-Orbit Insurance for such a Satellite (or
portion, as applicable) resulting from a claim of loss under such policy causes
a failure to comply with the proviso in the immediately preceding sentence, the
Borrower and its Restricted Subsidiaries shall be deemed to be in compliance
with such proviso for the 120 days immediately following such expiration or
non-renewal, PROVIDED that the Borrower or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries,
as the case may be, procures such In-Orbit Insurance or provides such In-Orbit
Contingency Protection as necessary to comply with such proviso within such
120-day period. In the event of the unavailability of any In-Orbit Contingency
Protection for any reason, the Borrower or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries,
as the case may be, shall, subject to the first proviso above, within 120 days
of such unavailability, be required to have in effect In-Orbit Insurance
complying with clause (ii) or (iii) above, as applicable, with respect to all
Satellites (or portions, as applicable), other than Excluded Satellites that the
unavailable In-Orbit Contingency Protection was intended to protect and for so
long as such In-Orbit Contingency Protection is unavailable, PROVIDED that the
Borrower and its Restricted Subsidiaries shall be considered in compliance with
this insurance covenant for the 120 days immediately following such
unavailability.

          (b) The Borrower will, and the Borrower will cause each of its
Restricted Subsidiaries to, use its reasonable best efforts to at all times keep
the respective property of the Borrower and its Restricted Subsidiaries (except
(x) real or personal property leased or financed through third parties in
accordance with this Agreement and (y) satellites) insured in favor of the
Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Secured Parties, and all policies or
certificates with respect to such insurance (and any general liability, umbrella
liability coverage and workers' compensation insurance (to the extent permitted
by law) maintained by, or on behalf of, the Borrower or any Restricted
Subsidiary of the Borrower) (i) shall be endorsed to the Administrative Agent's
reasonable satisfaction for the benefit of the Administrative Agent (including,
without limitation, by naming the Administrative Agent as certificate holder,
mortgagee and loss payee with respect to real property, certificate holder and
loss payee with respect to personal property, additional insured with respect to
general liability and umbrella liability coverage and (to the extent permitted
by law) certificate holder with respect to workers' compensation insurance),
(ii) shall state that such insurance policies shall not be cancelled or
materially changed without at least 30 days' prior written notice thereof by the
respective insurer to the Administrative Agent, PROVIDED that with respect to
any launch insurance or In-Orbit Insurance, such notice is available, and if
available, on such terms as may be available, and (iii) shall, upon the request
of the Administrative Agent, be deposited with the Administrative Agent for the
benefit of the Secured Parties.

          (c) If the Borrower or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries shall fail
to maintain all insurance in accordance with this Section 9.03, or if the
Borrower or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries shall fail to so name the
Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Secured Parties as an additional
insured, mortgagee or loss payee, as the case may be, or so deposit all
certificates with respect thereto, the Administrative Agent shall have the right
(but shall be under no obligation), upon reasonable prior notice to the Borrower
of its intention to do so, to procure

                                       -90-
<PAGE>

such insurance on such terms and against such risks as are required hereby, and
the Borrower agrees to reimburse the Administrative Agent for any premium paid
therefor.

          9.4. PAYMENT OF TAXES The Borrower will pay and discharge, and the
Borrower will cause each of the Subsidiaries to pay and discharge, all material
taxes, assessments and governmental charges or levies imposed upon it or upon
its income or profits, or upon any properties belonging to it, prior to the date
on which material penalties attach thereto, and all lawful material claims that,
if unpaid, could reasonably be expected to become a material Lien upon any
properties of the Borrower or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries, PROVIDED that
none of the Borrower or any of the Subsidiaries shall be required to pay any
such tax, assessment, charge, levy or claim that is being contested in good
faith and by proper proceedings if it has maintained adequate reserves (in the
good faith judgment of the management of the Borrower) with respect thereto in
accordance with GAAP and the failure to pay could not reasonably be expected to
result in a Material Adverse Effect.

          9.5. CONSOLIDATED CORPORATE FRANCHISES. The Borrower will do, and the
Borrower will cause each Material Subsidiary to do, or cause to be done, all
things necessary to preserve and keep in full force and effect its existence,
corporate rights and authority, except to the extent that the failure to do so
could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect; PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, that the Borrower and its Subsidiaries may consummate any transaction
permitted under Section 10.3, 10.4 or 10.5.

          9.6. COMPLIANCE WITH STATUTES, REGULATIONS, ETC. The Borrower will,
and the Borrower will cause each Subsidiary to, comply with all applicable laws,
rules, regulations and orders applicable to it or its property (including all
FCC Licenses and all other governmental approvals or authorizations required to
launch and operate the Satellites and the TT&C Stations related thereto) and to
transmit signals to and receive transmissions from the Satellites, and to
maintain all such FCC Licenses and other governmental approvals or
authorizations in full force and effect, in each case except where the failure
to do so could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect (it
being understood that any failure as it may relate to any FCC License for a
Satellite that is yet to be launched shall not, in itself, be considered or
deemed to result in a Material Adverse Effect).

          9.7. ERISA. Promptly after the Borrower or any Subsidiary or any ERISA
Affiliate knows or has reason to know of the occurrence of any of the following
events that, individually or in the aggregate (including in the aggregate such
events previously disclosed or exempt from disclosure hereunder, to the extent
the liability therefor remains outstanding), would be reasonably likely to have
a Material Adverse Effect, the Borrower will deliver to each of the Lenders a
certificate of an Authorized Officer or any other senior officer of the Borrower
setting forth details as to such occurrence and the action, if any, that the
Borrower, such Subsidiary or such ERISA Affiliate is required or proposes to
take, together with any notices (required, proposed or otherwise) given to or
filed with or by the Borrower, such Subsidiary, such ERISA Affiliate, the PBGC,
a Plan participant (other than notices relating to an individual participant's
benefits) or the Plan administrator with respect thereto: that a Reportable
Event has occurred; that an accumulated funding deficiency has been incurred or
an application is to be made to the Secretary of the Treasury for a waiver or
modification of the minimum funding standard (includ-

                                       -91-
<PAGE>

ing any required installment payments) or an extension of any amortization
period under Section 412 of the Code with respect to a Plan; that a Plan having
an Unfunded Current Liability has been or is to be terminated, reorganized,
partitioned or declared insolvent under Title IV of ERISA (including the giving
of written notice thereof); that a Plan has an Unfunded Current Liability that
has or will result in a lien under ERISA or the Code; that proceedings will be
or have been instituted to terminate a Plan having an Unfunded Current Liability
(including the giving of written notice thereof); that a proceeding has been
instituted against the Borrower, a Subsidiary or an ERISA Affiliate pursuant to
Section 515 of ERISA to collect a delinquent contribution to a Plan; that the
PBGC has notified the Borrower, any Subsidiary or any ERISA Affiliate of its
intention to appoint a trustee to administer any Plan; that the Borrower, any
Subsidiary or any ERISA Affiliate has failed to make a required installment or
other payment pursuant to Section 412 of the Code with respect to a Plan; or
that the Borrower, any Subsidiary or any ERISA Affiliate has incurred or will
incur (or has been notified in writing that it will incur) any liability
(including any contingent or secondary liability) to or on account of a Plan
pursuant to Section 409, 502(i), 502(l), 515, 4062, 4063, 4064, 4069, 4201 or
4204 of ERISA or Section 4971 or 4975 of the Code.

          9.8. MAINTENANCE OF PROPERTIES. The Borrower will, and the Borrower
will cause each of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, keep and maintain all
property material to the conduct of its business in good working order and
condition, ordinary wear and tear excepted, which shall include, in the case of
Satellites (other than Satellites yet to be launched), the provision of
tracking, telemetry, control and monitoring of Satellites in their designated
orbital positions in accordance with prudent and diligent standards in the
commercial satellite industry, except to the extent that the failure to do so
could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

          9.9. TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES. The Borrower will conduct, and
cause each of the Restricted Subsidiaries to conduct, all transactions with any
of its Affiliates (other than the Borrower or its Restricted Subsidiaries)
involving aggregate consideration in excess of $10,000,000 on terms that are
substantially as favorable to the Borrower or such Restricted Subsidiary as it
would obtain in a comparable arm's-length transaction with a Person that is not
an Affiliate, PROVIDED that the foregoing restrictions shall not apply to (a)
the payment, on a quarterly basis, of management and consulting fees to the
Sponsors in an aggregate amount not to exceed in any fiscal year of the Borrower
the greater of (x) $6,250,000 and (y) 1.25% of Consolidated EBITDA of the
Borrower and its Restricted Subsidiaries for the immediately preceding fiscal
year, (b) upon the consummation of a Qualified IPO, as consideration for the
termination of existing management, consulting or financial or similar services

the Borrower), as such agreement is in effect on the date hereof or as modified,
amended or supplemented in any manner not materially adverse to the Lenders, (c)
the payment of customary investment banking fees paid to the Sponsors for
services rendered to the Borrower and the Restricted Subsidiaries in connection
with divestitures, acquisitions, financings and other transactions, (d)
transactions conducted in accordance with the Intercompany Services Agreement as
in effect on the date hereof or as modified, amended or supplemented in any
manner not materially adverse to the Lenders, (e) the Transactions and
transactions to effect the same, including the payment of fees and expenses
related thereto, (f) customary fees paid to and

                                       -92-
<PAGE>

customary indemnities provided to members of the board of directors of the
Borrower, its parent entities and the Subsidiaries, (g) transactions permitted
by Section 10.1, 10.3, 10.5 or 10.6, (h) employment and other compensation
arrangements with respect to the procurement of services of officers,
consultants and employees in the ordinary course of business, (i) the issuance

the Borrower, (j) the entering into of any tax sharing agreement or arrangement
relating to payments, whether directly or by dividend, by the Borrower or a
Restricted Subsidiary to any parent of the Borrower if such parent is required
to file a consolidated, unitary or similar tax return reflecting income of the
Borrower or its Restricted Subsidiaries in an amount equal to the portion of
such taxes attributable to the Borrower and/or its Restricted Subsidiaries that
are not payable directly by the Borrower or its Restricted Subsidiaries, but not
to exceed the amount that the Borrower or such Restricted Subsidiaries would
have been required to pay in respect of taxes if the Borrower and such
Restricted Subsidiaries had been required to pay such taxes directly as
standalone taxpayers (or a standalone group separate from such parent), (k)
agreements in effect on the Closing Date and listed on SCHEDULE 9.9 and

a director of Holdings or such parent, as the case may be, on any matter
involving such Person.

          9.10. END OF FISCAL YEARS; FISCAL QUARTERS. Holdings and the Borrower
will, for financial reporting purposes, cause (a) each of their, and each of
their respective Subsidiaries', fiscal years to end on December 31 of each year
and (b) each of their, and each of their respective Subsidiaries', fiscal
quarters to end on dates consistent with such fiscal year-end and the Borrower's
past practice; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the Borrower may, upon written notice to
the Administrative Agent, change the financial reporting convention specified
above to any other financial reporting convention reasonably acceptable to the
Administrative Agent, in which case Holdings, the Borrower and the
Administrative Agent will, and are hereby authorized by the Lenders to, make any
adjustments to this Agreement that are necessary in order to reflect such change
in financial reporting.

          9.11. ADDITIONAL GUARANTORS AND GRANTORS. Except as set forth in
Section 10.1(A)(j) or (A)(k), the Borrower will cause (i) each direct or
indirect Material Subsidiary (other than any Unrestricted Subsidiary or a
Receivables Subsidiary) formed or otherwise purchased or acquired after the
Closing Date (including pursuant to a Permitted Acquisition), (ii) each
Subsidiary (other than any Unrestricted Subsidiary) that is not a Material
Subsidiary on the Closing Date but subsequently becomes a Material Subsidiary
and (iii) each inactive Subsidiary listed on Schedule 1.1(d) hereto (unless such
Subsidiary is designated an Unrestricted Subsidiary in accordance with terms of
this Agreement) which acquires any material assets or is otherwise no longer
deemed inactive, in each case to execute a supplement to the Guarantee in the
form of Annex B thereto and a Supplemental Security Agreement; PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, that no Foreign Subsidiary shall be required to take such actions if,
and to the extent that, based upon written advice of local counsel reasonably
satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, the Borrower and/or such Foreign
Subsidiary concludes that the taking of such actions would violate the laws of
the

                                       -93-
<PAGE>

jurisdiction in which such Foreign Subsidiary is organized; PROVIDED FURTHER,
that if steps (for example, limiting the amount guaranteed) can be taken so that
such violation would not exist, then, if requested by the Administrative Agent,
the respective Foreign Subsidiary shall enter into a modified Guarantee and/or
modified Security Documents that provide, to the maximum extent permissible
under applicable law, as many of the benefits as possible as are provided
pursuant to the Guarantee and the Security Documents executed and delivered on
the Closing Date.

          9.12. PLEDGES OF ADDITIONAL STOCK AND EVIDENCE OF INDEBTEDNESS.

          (a) Except as set forth in Section 10.1(A)(j) or (A)(k), Holdings will
pledge as a first priority Lien the capital stock of the Borrower and the
Borrower will pledge, and, if applicable, will cause each Material Subsidiary to
pledge, to the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Secured Parties, (i)
all the capital stock of each Subsidiary (other than any Unrestricted
Subsidiary) and Minority Investments other than, up to an aggregate Fair Market
Value of $30,000,000, Minority Investments with a Fair Market Value of less than
$15,000,000 (unless such pledge is prohibited by an applicable joint venture,
shareholder or similar agreement) and held by the Borrower or a Subsidiary
Guarantor, in each case, formed or otherwise purchased or acquired after the
Closing Date, in each case pursuant to a supplement to the applicable Pledge
Agreement (or, if necessary, a new pledge agreement) in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, (ii) all evidences of
Indebtedness in excess of $1,000,000 received by the Borrower or any Subsidiary
Guarantor in connection with any disposition of assets pursuant to Section
10.4(b), in each case pursuant to a supplement to the applicable Pledge
Agreement (or, if necessary, a new pledge agreement) in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, and (iii) any global
promissory notes executed after the Closing Date evidencing Indebtedness of the
Borrower, each Subsidiary and each Minority Investment that is owing to the
Borrower or any Subsidiary Guarantor, in each case pursuant to a supplement to
the applicable Pledge Agreement (or, if necessary, a new pledge agreement) in
form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.

          (b) Holdings and the Borrower agrees that all Indebtedness in excess
of $20,000,000 of Holdings, the Borrower and each Subsidiary that is owing to
any Credit Party to the Pledge Agreement shall be evidenced by one or more
global promissory notes.

          (c) At all times on and after the Closing Date, Holdings and the
Borrower will cause each obligor and obligee of any loan or advance (including,
without limitation, pursuant to guarantees thereof or security thereof) which
are (x) made to the Borrower by Holdings or any of the Borrower's Subsidiaries
or (y) made to any Credit Party by a Subsidiary of the Borrower that is not a
Credit Party prior to the extension or incurrence of such loan or advance, to
execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an intercompany subordination
agreement substantially in the form of Exhibit I (as modified, amended or
supplemented from time to time, the "INTERCOMPANY SUBORDINATION AGREEMENT") or,
to the extent the Intercompany Subordination Agreement has previously come into
effect, a joinder agreement in respect of the Intercompany Subordination
Agreement and, in connection therewith, promptly execute and deliver all further
instruments, and take all further action, that the Administrative Agent may
reasonably require; PROVIDED that no such Intercompany Subordination Agreement
is required to be entered into in re-

                                       -94-
<PAGE>

spect of intercompany loans and advances in the aggregate not exceeding
$20,000,000, and with such further exceptions as the Administrative Agent may
agree.

          9.13. USE OF PROCEEDS. The Borrower will use the Letters of Credit and
the proceeds of all Loans for the purposes set forth in the introductory
statement to this Agreement.

          9.14. CHANGES IN BUSINESS.

          (a) The Borrower and the Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, will not
fundamentally and substantively alter the character of their business, taken as
a whole, from the business conducted or proposed to be conducted by the Borrower
and the Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, on the Closing Date and other business
activities that are complementary, ancillary incidental or related to,
reasonably similar to or a reasonable extension, development or expansion of any
of the foregoing (a "PERMITTED BUSINESS").

          (b) No License Subsidiary will engage in any line or lines of business
activity other than to hold FCC Licenses issued to it and to enter into
arrangements with the Borrower or other Restricted Subsidiaries (other than
other License Subsidiaries) to manage and operate such FCC Licenses under its
direction and control, in each case to the maximum extent permitted by
applicable law. The Borrower will cause all Subject Licenses at all times to be
held in the name of a License Subsidiary (which shall be the sole legal and
beneficial owner thereof). Any license issued after the Closing Date by the FCC
that constitutes a Subject License shall be held in the name of a License
Subsidiary (which shall be the sole legal and beneficial owner thereof).

          9.15. FURTHER ASSURANCES.

          (a) Holdings and the Borrower will, and will cause each other Credit
Party to, execute any and all further documents, financing statements,
agreements and instruments, and take all such further actions (including the
filing and recording of financing statements, fixture filings, mortgages, deeds
of trust and other documents), which may be required under any applicable law,
or which the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders may reasonably
request, in order to grant, preserve, protect and perfect the validity and
priority of the security interests created or intended to be created by the
Security Agreements, the Pledge Agreements or any Mortgage, all at the expense
of Holdings, the Borrower and the Restricted Subsidiaries.

          (b) If any assets (including any real estate or improvements thereto
or any interest therein) with a book value or fair market value in excess of
$15,000,000 are acquired by the Borrower or any other Credit Party after the
Closing Date (other than assets constituting Collateral under the Security
Agreements that become subject to the Lien of the Security Agreement upon
acquisition thereof) that are of the nature secured by the Security Agreements
or any Mortgage, as the case may be, the Borrower will notify the Administrative
Agent and the Lenders thereof, and, if requested by the Administrative Agent or
the Required Lenders, the Borrower will cause such assets to be subjected to a
Lien securing the applicable Obligations and will take, and cause the other
Credit Parties to take, such actions as shall be necessary or reasonably
requested by the Administrative Agent to grant and perfect such Liens (unless,
with respect to any such asset, same is subject to one or more agreements or
Liens permitted hereunder which agreements or Lien(s) prohibit the granting of a
security interest thereon as contemplated by this

                                       -95-
<PAGE>

clause (b), in which case the actions otherwise required by this Section 9.15(b)
with respect to such asset shall not be required to be taken until such
prohibitions cease to be applicable) consistent with the applicable requirements
of the Security Documents, including actions described in paragraph (a) of this
Section 9.15, all at the expense of the Credit Parties. Any Mortgage delivered
to the Administrative Agent in accordance with the preceding sentence or
pursuant to Section 9.15(c) shall be accompanied by (x) a policy or policies of
title insurance issued by a nationally recognized title insurance company
insuring the Lien of each Mortgage as a valid first Lien on the Mortgaged
Property described therein, free of any other Liens except as expressly
permitted by Section 10.2, together with such endorsements, coinsurance and
reinsurance as the Administrative Agent may reasonably request and (y) an
opinion of local counsel to the Borrower (or in the event a Subsidiary of the
Borrower is the mortgagor, to such Subsidiary) in form and substance
satisfactory to the Administrative Agent. Any provision contained herein or in
the Security Documents to the contrary notwithstanding, the Collateral shall not
include at any time any FCC License to the extent (but only to the extent) that
at such time the Administrative Agent may not validly possess a security
interest therein pursuant to the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, and the

possession all items referred to in clause (iii) below) to cooperate in
providing the access codes, command codes and command encryption referred to in

of tracking, telemetry, control and monitoring services for any Satellite to
agree to, not change any access codes, command codes or command encryption
necessary to establish access to and perform tracking, telemetry, control and
monitoring of each Satellite at any time that an Event of Default exists and
such provider of tracking, telemetry, control and monitoring services, as the
case may be, has been notified by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent
thereof, without promptly furnishing to the Administrative Agent the new access
codes, command codes and command encryption necessary to establish access to and
perform tracking, telemetry, control and monitoring of such Satellite, once such
access codes, command codes and command encryption have been delivered to the
Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section 9.17.

indirectly, Intelsat General Corporation to take, or fail to take, any action
that would violate the covenants and terms of this Agreement or cause any
representation or warranty contained in this Agreement to be untrue.

request of the Required Lenders, by written notice to the Borrower, take any or
all of the following actions, without prejudice to the rights of the
Administrative Agent or any Lender to enforce its claims against the Borrower,
except as otherwise specifically provided for in this Agreement (PROVIDED that,
if an Event of Default specified in Section 12.5 shall occur with respect to
Holdings, the Borrower or any Specified Subsidiary, the result that would occur
upon the giving of written notice by the Administrative Agent as specified in
clauses (i), (ii) and (iv) below shall occur automatically without the giving of
any such notice): (i) declare the Total Revolving Credit Commitment terminated,
whereupon the Commitments and Swingline Commitment, if any, of each Lender or
the Swingline Lender, as the case may be, shall forthwith terminate immediately
and any Fees theretofore accrued shall forthwith become due and payable without
any other notice of any kind; (ii) declare the principal of and any accrued
interest and fees in respect of all Loans and all Obligations owing hereunder
and thereunder to be, whereupon the same shall become, forthwith due and payable
without presentment, demand, protest or other notice of any kind, all of which
are hereby waived by the Borrower; (iii) terminate any Letter of Credit that may
be terminated in accordance with its terms; and/or (iv) direct the Borrower to
pay (and the Borrower agrees that upon receipt of such notice, or upon the
occurrence of an Event of Default specified in Section 12.5 with respect to the
Borrower or any Specified Subsidiary, it will pay) to the Administrative Agent
at the Administrative Agent's Office such additional amounts of cash, to be held
as security for the Borrower's respective reimbursement obligations for Drawings
that may subsequently occur thereunder, equal to the aggregate Stated Amount of
all Letters of Credit issued and then outstanding.

          12.14. PERMITTED EQUITY ISSUANCE. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Section 12, in the event of any Event of Default
under the covenant set forth in Section 11 and until the expiration of the tenth
(10th) day after the date on which financial statements are required to be
delivered with respect to the applicable fiscal quarter hereunder, Holdings may
engage in a Permitted Equity Issuance to the Sponsors, Intelsat Bermuda or any
Affiliate of Intelsat Bermuda other than Holdings and its Subsidiaries and apply
the amount of the Net Cash Proceeds thereof to increase Consolidated EBITDA with
respect to such applicable quarter; PROVIDED that such Net Cash Proceeds (i) are
actually received by Holdings and contributed as common equity to the Borrower
(including through capital contribution of such Net Cash Proceeds by Intelsat
Bermuda to Holdings and by Holdings to the Borrower) no later than ten (10) days
after the date on which financial statements are required to be delivered with
respect to such fiscal quarter hereunder, (ii) are not otherwise utilized to
increase the Applicable Amount or as the basis for incurring Contribution
Indebtedness and (iii) do not exceed the aggregate amount

                                      -115-

<PAGE>

necessary to cure such Event of Default under Section 11, as applicable, for any
applicable period. The parties hereby acknowledge that the foregoing may not be
relied on for purposes of calculating any financial ratios other than as
applicable to Section 11 and shall not result in any adjustment to any amounts
other than the amount of the Consolidated EBITDA referred to in the immediately
preceding sentence. In each period of four consecutive fiscal quarters, there
shall be at least two (2) fiscal quarters in which no cure set forth above is
made.

          SECTION 13. THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT.

          13.1. APPOINTMENT. Each Lender hereby irrevocably designates and
appoints the Administrative Agent as the agent of such Lender under this
Agreement and the other Credit Documents, and each such Lender irrevocably
authorizes the Administrative Agent, in such capacity, to take such action on
its behalf under the provisions of this Agreement and the other Credit Documents
and to exercise such powers and perform such duties as are expressly delegated
to the Administrative Agent by the terms of this Agreement and the other Credit
Documents, together with such other powers as are reasonably incidental thereto.
Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary elsewhere in this Agreement, the
Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or responsibilities, except those
expressly set forth herein, or any fiduciary relationship with any Lender, and
no implied covenants, functions, responsibilities, duties, obligations or
liabilities shall be read into this Agreement or any other Credit Document or
otherwise exist against the Administrative Agent. The Syndication Agent, in its
capacity as such, shall have no obligations, duties or responsibilities under
this Agreement but shall be entitled to all benefits of this Section 13.

          13.2. DELEGATION OF DUTIES. The Administrative Agent may execute any
of its duties under this Agreement and the other Credit Documents by or through
agents or attorneys-in-fact and shall be entitled to advice of counsel
concerning all matters pertaining to such duties. The Administrative Agent shall
not be responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any agents or
attorneys-in-fact selected by it with reasonable care.

          13.3. EXCULPATORY PROVISIONS. Neither the Administrative Agent nor any
of its officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or Affiliates
shall be (a) liable for any action lawfully taken or omitted to be taken by it
or such Person under or in connection with this Agreement or any other Credit
Document (except for its or such Person's own gross negligence or willful
misconduct) or (b) responsible in any manner to any of the Lenders for any
recitals, statements, representations or warranties made by Holdings, the
Borrower, any Guarantor, any other Credit Party or any officer thereof contained
in this Agreement or any other Credit Document or in any certificate, report,
statement or other document referred to or provided for in, or received by the
Administrative Agent under or in connection with, this Agreement or any other
Credit Document or for the value, validity, effectiveness, genuineness,
enforceability or sufficiency of this Agreement or any other Credit Document or
for any failure of Holdings, the Borrower, any Guarantor or any other Credit
Party to perform its obligations hereunder or thereunder. The Administrative
Agent shall not be under any obligation to any Lender to ascertain or to inquire
as to the observance or performance of any of the agreements contained in, or
conditions of, this Agreement or any other Credit Document, or to inspect the
properties, books or records of the Borrower.

                                      -116-

<PAGE>

          13.4. RELIANCE BY ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT. The Administrative Agent shall
be entitled to rely, and shall be fully protected in relying, upon any writing,
resolution, notice, consent, certificate, affidavit, letter, telecopy, telex or
teletype message, statement, order or other document or conversation believed by
it to be genuine and correct and to have been signed, sent or made by the proper
Person or Persons and upon advice and statements of legal counsel (including
counsel to the Borrower and/or Holdings), independent accountants and other
experts selected by the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent may deem
and treat the Lender specified in the Register with respect to any amount owing
hereunder as the owner thereof for all purposes unless a written notice of
assignment, negotiation or transfer thereof shall have been filed with the
Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent shall be fully justified in
failing or refusing to take any action under this Agreement or any other Credit
Document unless it shall first receive such advice or concurrence of the
Required Lenders as it deems appropriate or it shall first be indemnified to its
satisfaction by the Lenders against any and all liability and expense that may
be incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to take any such action. The
Administrative Agent shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in
refraining from acting, under this Agreement and the other Credit Documents in
accordance with a request of the Required Lenders, and such request and any
action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding upon all the
Lenders and all future holders of the Loans.

          13.5. NOTICE OF DEFAULT. The Administrative Agent shall not be deemed
to have knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default
hereunder unless the Administrative Agent has received notice from a Lender or
the Borrower referring to this Agreement, describing such Default or Event of
Default and stating that such notice is a "notice of default." In the event that
the Administrative Agent receives such a notice, the Administrative Agent shall
give notice thereof to the Lenders. The Administrative Agent shall take such
action with respect to such Default or Event of Default as shall be reasonably
directed by the Required Lenders, PROVIDED that unless and until the
Administrative Agent shall have received such directions, the Administrative
Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) take such action, or refrain from
taking such action, with respect to such Default or Event of Default as it shall
deem advisable in the best interests of the Lenders (except to the extent that
this Agreement requires that such action be taken only with the approval of the
Required Lenders or each of the Lenders, as applicable).

          13.6. NON-RELIANCE ON ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT AND OTHER LENDERS. Each
Lender expressly acknowledges that neither the Administrative Agent nor any of
its officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or Affiliates has
made any representations or warranties to it and that no act by the
Administrative Agent hereinafter taken, including any review of the affairs of
the Borrower, any Guarantor or any other Credit Party, shall be deemed to
constitute any representation or warranty by the Administrative Agent to any
Lender. Each Lender represents to the Administrative Agent that it has,
independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other
Lender, and based on such documents and information as it has deemed
appropriate, made its own appraisal of and investigation into the business,
operations, property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of
Holdings, the Borrower, any Guarantor and any other Credit Party and made its
own decision to make its Loans hereunder and enter into this Agreement. Each
Lender also represents that it will, independently and without reliance upon the
Administrative Agent or any other Lender, and based on such documents and
information as

                                      -117-

<PAGE>

it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit analysis,
appraisals and decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement and
the other Credit Documents, and to make such investigation as it deems necessary
to inform itself as to the business, operations, property, financial and other
condition and creditworthiness of Holdings, the Borrower, any Guarantor and any
other Credit Party. Except for notices, reports and other documents expressly
required to be furnished to the Lenders by the Administrative Agent hereunder,
the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty or responsibility to provide
any Lender with any credit or other information concerning the business, assets,
operations, properties, financial condition, prospects or creditworthiness of
Holdings, the Borrower, any Guarantor or any other Credit Party that may come
into the possession of the Administrative Agent or any of its officers,
directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or Affiliates.

          13.7. INDEMNIFICATION. The Lenders agree to indemnify the
Administrative Agent in its capacity as such (to the extent not reimbursed by
the Borrower and without limiting the obligation of the Borrower to do so),
ratably according to their respective portions of the Total Credit Exposure in
effect on the date on which indemnification is sought (or, if indemnification is
sought after the date upon which the Commitments shall have terminated and the
Loans shall have been paid in full, ratably in accordance with their respective
portions of the Total Credit Exposure in effect immediately prior to such date),
from and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages,
penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any
kind whatsoever that may at any time (including at any time following the
payment of the Loans) be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against the
Administrative Agent in any way relating to or arising out of, the Commitments,
this Agreement, any of the other Credit Documents or any documents contemplated
by or referred to herein or therein or the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby or any action taken or omitted by the Administrative Agent under or in
connection with any of the foregoing, PROVIDED that no Lender shall be liable
for the payment of any portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses,
damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements
resulting from the Administrative Agent's gross negligence or willful
misconduct. The agreements in this Section 13.7 shall survive the payment of the
Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder.

          13.8. ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT IN ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY. The
Administrative Agent and its Affiliates may make loans to, accept deposits from
and generally engage in any kind of business with Holdings, the Borrower, any
Guarantor, and any other Credit Party as though the Administrative Agent were
not the Administrative Agent hereunder and under the other Credit Documents.
With respect to the Loans made by it, the Administrative Agent shall have the
same rights and powers under this Agreement and the other Credit Documents as
any Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative
Agent, and the terms "Lender" and "Lenders" shall include the Administrative
Agent in its individual capacity.

          13.9. SUCCESSOR AGENT. The Administrative Agent may resign as
Administrative Agent upon 20 days' prior written notice to the Lenders and the
Borrower. If the Administrative Agent shall resign as Administrative Agent under
this Agreement and the other Credit Documents, then the Required Lenders shall
appoint from among the Lenders a successor agent for the Lenders, which
successor agent shall be approved by the Borrower (which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld) so long as no Default or Event of Default is continuing,
where-

                                      -118-

<PAGE>

upon such successor agent shall succeed to the rights, powers and duties of
the Administrative Agent, and the term "Administrative Agent" shall mean such
successor agent effective upon such appointment and approval, and the former
Administrative Agent's rights, powers and duties as Administrative Agent shall
be terminated, without any other or further act or deed on the part of such
former Administrative Agent or any of the parties to this Agreement or any
holders of the Loans. After any retiring Administrative Agent's resignation as
Administrative Agent, the provisions of this Section 12 shall inure to its
benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was
Administrative Agent under this Agreement and the other Credit Documents.

          13.10. WITHHOLDING TAX. To the extent required by any applicable law,
the Administrative Agent may withhold from any interest payment to any Lender an
amount equivalent to any applicable withholding tax. If any Governmental
Authority asserts a claim that the Administrative Agent did not properly
withhold tax from amounts paid to or for the account of any Lender (because the
appropriate form was not delivered, was not properly executed, or because such
Lender failed to notify the Administrative Agent of a change in circumstances
which rendered the exemption from, or reduction of, withholding tax ineffective,
or for any other reason), such Lender shall indemnify the Administrative Agent
(to the extent that the Administrative Agent has not already been reimbursed by
the Borrower and without limiting the obligation of the Borrower to do so) fully
for all amounts paid, directly or indirectly, by the Administrative Agent as tax
or otherwise, including penalties and interest, together with all expenses
incurred, including legal expenses, allocated staff costs and any out of pocket
expenses.

          13.11. SPECIAL APPOINTMENT OF ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT FOR GERMAN PLEDGE
AGREEMENT.

          (a) (i) Each Lender that is or will become party to this Agreement
     hereby appoints the Administrative Agent as trustee (TREUHAENDER) and
     administrator for the purpose of holding in trust (TREUHAND),
     administering, enforcing and releasing the German Security for the benefit
     of the Secured Parties, (ii) the Administrative Agent accepts its
     appointment as a trustee and administrator of the German Security on the
     terms and subject to the conditions set out in this Agreement and (iii) the
     Lenders, the Administrative Agent and all other parties to this Agreement
     agree that, in relation to the German Security, no Lender shall exercise
     any independent power to enforce any German Security or take any other
     action in relation to the enforcement of the German Security, or make or
     receive any declarations in relation thereto.

          (b) The Administrative Agent shall hold and administer any German
     Security which is security assigned, transferred or pledged under German
     law to it as a trustee for the benefit of the Secured Parties.

          (c) Each Lender hereby instructs the Administrative Agent (with the
     right of subdelegation) to enter into any documents evidencing German
     Security and to make and accept all declarations and take all actions as it
     considers necessary or useful in connection with any German Security on
     behalf of the Secured Parties. The Administrative Agent shall further be
     entitled to rescind, release, amend and/or execute new and different
     documents securing the German Security in accordance with Section 14.1.

                                      -119-

<PAGE>

          (d) The Secured Parties and the Administrative Agent agree that all
     rights and claims constituted by the abstract acknowledgement of
     indebtedness pursuant to Section 14.20 and all proceeds held by the
     Administrative Agent pursuant to or in connection with such abstract
     acknowledgement of indebtedness are held by the Administrative Agent with
     effect from the date of such abstract acknowledgement of indebtedness in
     trust for the Secured Parties and will be administered in accordance with
     Section 5.4 of the U.S Security Agreement. The Secured Parties and the
     Administrative Agent agree further that Intelsat Global's obligations under
     such abstract acknowledgement of indebtedness shall not increase the total
     amount of the Intelsat Global Secured Obligations and shall not result in
     any additional liability of Intelsat Global or otherwise prejudice the
     rights of Intelsat Global. Accordingly, payment of the obligations under
     such abstract acknowledgement of indebtedness shall, to the same extent,
     discharge the corresponding Obligations and vice versa.

          13.12. U.K. SECURITY DOCUMENTS. Section 1 of the Trustee Act 2000
shall not apply to the duties of the Administrative Agent in relation to the
trusts constituted by the U.K. Pledge Agreement and the U.K. Security Agreement.
Where there are any inconsistencies between the Trustee Act 1925 or the Trustee
Act 2000 and the provisions of this Agreement and those of the U.K. Pledge
Agreement and the U.K. Security Agreement, the provisions of this Agreement and
those of the U.K. Pledge Agreement and the U.K. Security Agreement shall, to the
extent permitted by law, prevail, and in the case of any inconsistency with the
Trustee Act 2000, the provisions of this Agreement and those of the U.K. Pledge
Agreement and the U.K. Security Agreement shall constitute a restriction or
exclusion for the purposes of that Act.

          SECTION 14. MISCELLANEOUS.

          14.1. AMENDMENTS AND WAIVERS. Neither this Agreement nor any other
Credit Document, nor any terms hereof or thereof may be amended, supplemented or

or extend the final expiration date of any Letter of Credit beyond the L/C

change any Tranche B Term Loan Commitment to a Revolving Credit Commitment, in
each case without the prior written consent of each Lender directly and
adversely affected thereby, or (vii) release all or substantially all of the
Guarantors under the Guarantee (except as expressly permitted by the Guarantee)
or release all or substantially all of the Collateral under the Pledge
Agreements, the Security Agreements and the Mortgages, in each case without the

prepayment to be received by any Lender holding any Tranche B Term Loans, in
each case without the written consent of the Required Tranche B Term Loan

consent with respect to any of the terms and provisions (and related
definitions) of Section 11 shall be effective without the written consent of the
Requisite Revolving Credit Lenders and (B) only the Requisite Revolving Credit
Lenders (or the Administrative Agent with the prior written consent thereof), on
the one hand, and the Borrower, on the other hand, may amend, supplement or
otherwise modify or waive any of the terms and provisions (and related
definitions) of Section 11. Any such waiver and any such amendment, supplement
or modification shall apply equally to each of the affected Lenders and shall be
binding upon the Borrower, such Lenders, the Administrative Agent and all future
holders of the affected Loans. In the case of any waiver, the Borrower, the
Lenders and the Administrative Agent shall be restored to their former positions
and rights hereunder and under the other Credit Documents, and any Default or
Event of Default waived shall be deemed to be cured and not continuing, it being
understood that no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other Default
or Event of Default or impair any right consequent thereon.

delay in exercising, on the part of the Administrative Agent or any Lender, any
right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder or under the other Credit Documents

exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, remedy, power or privilege.
The rights, remedies, powers and privileges herein provided are cumulative and

<PAGE>

of its Subsidiaries or any of the Real Estate (all the foregoing in this clause
(d), collectively, the "INDEMNIFIED LIABILITIES"), PROVIDED that the Borrower
shall have no obligation hereunder to the Administrative Agent or any Lender nor
any of their respective directors, officers, employees and agents with respect
to indemnified liabilities to the extent attributable to (i) the gross
negligence or willful misconduct of the party to be indemnified as determined in
a final and non-appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction or (ii)
disputes among the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and/or their transferees.
The agreements in this Section 14.5 shall survive repayment of the Loans and all
other amounts payable hereunder.

          14.6. SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS; PARTICIPATIONS AND ASSIGNMENTS.

          (a) The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure
to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns
permitted hereby (including any Affiliate of the Letter of Credit Issuer that
issues any Letter of Credit), except that (i) the Borrower may not assign or
otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior
written consent of each Lender (and any attempted assignment or transfer by the
Borrower or without such consent shall be null and void) and (ii) no Lender may
assign or otherwise transfer its rights or obligations hereunder except in
accordance with this Section 14.6. Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or
implied, shall be construed to confer upon any Person (other than the parties
hereto, their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby (including any
Affiliate of the Letter of Credit Issuer that issues any Letter of Credit),
Participants (to the extent provided in paragraph (c) of this Section 14.6) and,
to the extent expressly contemplated hereby, the Related Parties of each of the
Administrative Agent, the Letter of Credit Issuer and the Lenders) any legal or
equitable right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement.

          (b) (i) Subject to the conditions set forth in paragraph (b)(ii)
below, any Lender may assign to one or more assignees all or a portion of its
rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its
Commitments and the Loans at the time owing to it) with the prior written
consent (such consent not be unreasonably withheld or delayed; it being
understood that, without limitation, the Borrower shall have the right to
withhold its consent to any assignment if, in order for such assignment to
comply with applicable law, the Borrower would be required to obtain the consent
of, or make any filing or registration with, any Governmental Authority) of:

          (A) the Borrower (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
     delayed), PROVIDED that no consent of the Borrower shall be required for an
     assignment to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender (unless increased costs
     would result therefrom except if an Event of Default under Section 12.1 or
     Section 12.5 has occurred and is continuing), an Approved Fund or, if an
     Event of Default under Section 12.1 or Section 12.5 has occurred and is
     continuing, any other assignee; and

          (B) the Administrative Agent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
     withheld or delayed), and, in the case of Revolving Credit Commitments or
     Revolving Credit Loans only, the Swingline Lender and the applicable Letter
     of Credit Issuer, PROVIDED that no consent of the Administrative Agent, the
     Swingline Lender or the Letter of Credit Issuer, as applicable, shall be
     required for an assignment of (1) any Commitment to an assignee that is a
     Lender with a Commitment of the same Class immediately prior to giv-

                                      -124-

<PAGE>

     ing effect to such assignment or (2) any Term Loan to a Lender, an
     Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund.

          (ii) Assignments shall be subject to the following additional
conditions:

          (A) except in the case of an assignment to a Lender, an Affiliate of a
     Lender or an Approved Fund or an assignment of the entire remaining amount
     of the assigning Lender's Commitment or Loans of any Class, the amount of
     the Commitment or Loans of the assigning Lender subject to each such
     assignment (determined as of the date the Assignment and Acceptance with
     respect to such assignment is delivered to the Administrative Agent) shall
     not be less than $5,000,000 (or, in the case of a Tranche B Term Loan
     Commitment or Tranche B Term Loan, $1,000,000), and increments of
     $1,000,000 in excess thereof, unless each of the Borrower and the
     Administrative Agent otherwise consents (which consents shall not be
     unreasonably withheld or delayed), PROVIDED that no such consent of the
     Borrower shall be required if an Event of Default under Section 12.1 or
     Section 12.5 has occurred and is continuing; PROVIDED, FURTHER, that
     contemporaneous assignments to a single assignee made by Affiliates of
     Lenders and related Approved Funds shall be aggregated for purposes of
     meeting the minimum assignment amount requirements stated above;

          (B) each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of a
     proportionate part of all the assigning Lender's rights and obligations
     under this Agreement, PROVIDED that this clause shall not be construed to
     prohibit the assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning
     Lender's rights and obligations in respect of one Class of Commitments or
     Loans;

          (C) the parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to the
     Administrative Agent an Assignment and Acceptance, together with a
     processing and recordation fee of $3,500, PROVIDED that only one such fee
     shall be payable in the event of simultaneous assignments to or from two or
     more Approved Funds; and

          (D) the assignee, if it shall not be a Lender, shall deliver to the
     Administrative Agent an administrative questionnaire in a form approved by
     the Administrative Agent (the "ADMINISTRATIVE QUESTIONNAIRE").

          For the purpose of this Section 14.6(b), the term "APPROVED FUND"
means any Person (other than a natural person) that is engaged in making,
purchasing, holding or investing in bank loans and similar extensions of credit
in the ordinary course and that is administered, advised or managed by (a) a
Lender, (b) an Affiliate of a Lender or (c) an entity or an Affiliate of an
entity that administers, advises or manages a Lender.

          (iii) Subject to acceptance and recording thereof pursuant to
paragraph (b)(v) of this Section 14.6, from and after the effective date
specified in each Assignment and Acceptance, the assignee thereunder shall be a
party hereto and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and
Acceptance, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement,
and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest
assigned by such Assignment and Acceptance, be released from its obligations
under this Agreement (and, in the

                                      -125-

<PAGE>

case of an Assignment and Acceptance covering all of the assigning Lender's
rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a
party hereto but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.10,
2.11, 3.5, 5.4 and 14.5). Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or
obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this Section 14.6
shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a
participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with paragraph (c) of
this Section 14.6.

          (iv) The Administrative Agent, acting for this purpose as an agent of
the Borrower shall maintain at the Administrative Agent's Office a copy of each
Assignment and Acceptance delivered to it and a register for the recordation of
the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitments of, and principal
amount of the Loans and any payment made by the Letter of Credit Issuer under
any Letter of Credit owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from
time to time (the "REGISTER"). Further, the Register shall contain the name and
address of the Administrative Agent and the lending office through which each
such Person acts under this Agreement. The entries in the Register shall be
conclusive, and the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Letter of Credit
Issuer and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the
Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of
this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. The Register shall be
available for inspection by the Borrower, the Letter of Credit Issuer and any
Lender, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior
notice.

          (v) Upon its receipt of a duly completed Assignment and Acceptance
executed by an assigning Lender and an assignee, the assignee's completed
Administrative Questionnaire (unless the assignee shall already be a Lender
hereunder), the processing and recordation fee referred to in paragraph (b) of
this Section 14.6 and any written consent to such assignment required by
paragraph (b) of this Section 14.6, the Administrative Agent shall accept such
Assignment and Acceptance and record the information contained therein in the
Register. No assignment shall be effective for purposes of this Agreement unless
it has been recorded in the Register as provided in this paragraph.

          (c) (i) Any Lender may, without the consent of the Borrower, the
Administrative Agent, the Letter of Credit Issuer or the Swingline Lender, sell
participations to one or more banks or other entities (each, a "PARTICIPANT") in
all or a portion of such Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement
(including all or a portion of its Commitments and the Loans owing to it),
PROVIDED that (A) such Lender's obligations under this Agreement shall remain
unchanged, (B) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties
hereto for the performance of such obligations and (C) the Borrower, the
Administrative Agent, the Letter of Credit Issuer and the other Lenders shall
continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such
Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement. Any agreement or
instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide
that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to
approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement
or any other Credit Document, PROVIDED that such agreement or instrument may
provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree
to any amendment, modification or waiver described in the first proviso to
Section 14.1 that affects such Participant. Subject to paragraph (c)(ii) of this
Section 14.6, the Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the
benefits of Sections 2.10, 2.11 and 5.4

                                      -126-

<PAGE>

to the same extent as if it were a Lender (subject to the requirements of those
Sections) and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to paragraph (b)
of this Section 14.6. To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also
shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 14.8(b) as though it were a Lender,
PROVIDED such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 14.8(a) as though it
were a Lender.

          (ii) A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater
payment under Section 2.10 or 5.4 than the applicable Lender would have been
entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant,
unless the sale of the participation to such Participant is made with the
Borrower's prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld).

          (d) Any Lender may, without the consent of the Borrower or the
Administrative Agent, at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or
any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations of such
Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal
Reserve Bank, and this Section 14.6 shall not apply to any such pledge or
assignment of a security interest, PROVIDED that no such pledge or assignment of
a security interest shall release a Lender from any of its obligations hereunder
or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto. In
order to facilitate such pledge or assignment, the Borrower hereby agrees that,
upon request of any Lender at any time and from time to time after the Borrower
has made its initial borrowing hereunder, the Borrower shall provide to such
Lender, at the Borrower's own expense, a promissory note, substantially in the
form of EXHIBIT L-1 or L-2, as the case may be, evidencing the Tranche B Term
Loans and Increased Tranche B Term Loans, and Revolving Credit Loans and
Swingline Loans, respectively, owing to such Lender.

          (e) Subject to Section 14.16, the Borrower authorizes each Lender to
disclose to any Participant, secured creditor of such Lender or assignee (each,
a "TRANSFEREE") and any prospective Transferee any and all financial information
in such Lender's possession concerning the Borrower and its Affiliates that has
been delivered to such Lender by or on behalf of the Borrower and its Affiliates
pursuant to this Agreement or which has been delivered to such Lender by or on
behalf of the Borrower and its Affiliates in connection with such Lender's
credit evaluation of the Borrower and its Affiliates prior to becoming a party
to this Agreement.

          14.7. REPLACEMENTS OF LENDERS UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES.

          (a) The Borrower shall be permitted to replace any Lender that (a)
requests reimbursement for amounts owing pursuant to Section 2.10, 2.12, 3.5 or
5.4, (b) is affected in the manner described in Section 2.10(a)(iii) and as a
result thereof any of the actions described in such Section is required to be
taken or (c) becomes a Defaulting Lender, with a replacement bank or other
financial institution, PROVIDED that (i) such replacement does not conflict with
any Requirement of Law, (ii) no Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing at the time of such replacement, (iii) the Borrower shall repay (or
the replacement bank or institution shall purchase, at par) all Loans and other
amounts (other than any disputed amounts), pursuant to Section 2.10, 2.11, 2.12,
3.5 or 5.4, as the case may be) owing to such replaced Lender prior to the date
of replacement, (iv) the replacement bank or institution, if not already a
Lender, and the terms and conditions of such replacement, shall be reasonably
satisfactory to the Administrative

                                      -127-

<PAGE>

Agent, (v) the replaced Lender shall be obligated to make such replacement in
accordance with the provisions of Section 14.6 (PROVIDED that the Borrower shall
be obligated to pay the registration and processing fee referred to therein) and
(vi) any such replacement shall not be deemed to be a waiver of any rights that
the Borrower, the Administrative Agent or any other Lender shall have against
the replaced Lender.

          (b) If any Lender (such Lender, a "NON-CONSENTING LENDER") has failed
to consent to a proposed amendment, waiver, discharge or termination which
pursuant to the terms of Section 14.1 requires the consent of all of the Lenders
affected and with respect to which the Required Lenders shall have granted their
consent, then provided no Event of Default other than an Event of Default
relating to the proposed amendment, waiver, discharge or termination at issue
then exists, the Borrower shall have the right (unless such Non-Consenting
Lender grants such consent) to replace such Non-Consenting Lender by deeming
such Non-Consenting Lender to have assigned its Loans, and its Commitments
hereunder to one or more assignees reasonably acceptable to the Administrative
Agent, PROVIDED that: (a) all Obligations of the Borrower owing to such
Non-Consenting Lender being replaced shall be paid in full to such
Non-Consenting Lender concurrently with such assignment, and (b) the replacement
Lender shall purchase the foregoing by paying to such Non-Consenting Lender a
price equal to the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest
thereon. No action by or consent of the Non-Consenting Lender shall be necessary
in connection with such assignment, which shall be immediately and automatically
effective upon payment of such purchase price. In connection with any such
assignment, the Borrower, Administrative Agent, such Non-Consenting Lender and
the replacement Lender shall otherwise comply with Section 14.6.

          14.8. ADJUSTMENTS; SET-OFF.

          (a) If any Lender (a "BENEFITED LENDER") shall at any time receive any
payment of all or part of its Loans, or interest thereon, or receive any
collateral in respect thereof (whether voluntarily or involuntarily, by set-off,
pursuant to events or proceedings of the nature referred to in Section 12.5, or
otherwise), in a greater proportion than any such payment to or collateral
received by any other Lender, if any, in respect of such other Lender's Loans,
or interest thereon, such benefited Lender shall purchase for cash from the
other Lenders a participating interest in such portion of each such other
Lender's Loan, or shall provide such other Lenders with the benefits of any such
collateral, or the proceeds thereof, as shall be necessary to cause such
benefited Lender to share the excess payment or benefits of such collateral or
proceeds ratably with each of the Lenders; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that if all or any
portion of such excess payment or benefits is thereafter recovered from such
benefited Lender, such purchase shall be rescinded, and the purchase price and
benefits returned, to the extent of such recovery, but without interest.

          (b) After the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of
Default, in addition to any rights and remedies of the Lenders provided by law,
each Lender shall have the right, without prior notice to the Borrower, any such
notice being expressly waived by the Borrower to the extent permitted by
applicable law, upon any amount becoming due and payable by the Borrower
hereunder (whether at the stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) to
set-off and appropriate and apply against such amount any and all deposits
(general or special, time or

                                      -128-

demand, provisional or final), in any currency, and any other credits,
indebtedness or claims, in any currency, in each case whether direct or
indirect, absolute or contingent, matured or unmatured, at any time held or
owing by such Lender or any branch or agency thereof to or for the credit or the
account of the Borrower. Each Lender agrees promptly to notify the Borrower and
the Administrative Agent after any such set-off and application made by such
Lender, PROVIDED that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the
validity of such set-off and application.

the parties to this Agreement on any number of separate counterparts (including

of the copies of this Agreement signed by all the parties shall be lodged with
the Borrower and the Administrative Agent.

          14.10. SEVERABILITY. Any provision of this Agreement that is
prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction,
be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without
invalidating the remaining provisions hereof, and any such prohibition or
unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render
unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction.

          14.11. INTEGRATION. This Agreement and the other Credit Documents
represent the agreement of Holdings, the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and
the Lenders with respect to the subject matter hereof, and there are no

     or at such other address of which the Administrative Agent shall have been
     notified pursuant thereto;

          (iv) agrees that nothing herein shall affect the right to effect
     service of process in any other manner permitted by law or shall limit the
     right to sue in any other jurisdiction; and

attachment in aid of execution of judgment, execution of judgment or otherwise)
with respect to itself or any of its property or assets, hereby waives and
agrees not to plead or claim such immunity in respect of its obligations under

          (b) neither the Administrative Agent nor any Lender has any fiduciary
     relationship with or duty to Holdings or the Borrower arising out of or in
     connection with this Agreement or any of the other Credit Documents, and
     the relationship between Administrative Agent and Lenders, on one hand, and
     Holdings and the Borrower, on the other hand, in connection herewith or
     therewith is solely that of debtor and creditor; and

OPLOANSWEBADMIN@CITIGROUP.COM. Nothing in this Section 14.17 shall prejudice the
right of the Borrower, the Administrative Agent or any Lender to give any notice
or other communication pursuant to any Credit Document in any other manner
specified in such Credit Document.

                                      -131-

<PAGE>

          (ii) The Administrative Agent agrees that the receipt of the
Communications by the Agent at its e-mail address set forth above shall
constitute effective delivery of the Communications to the Agent for purposes of
the Credit Documents. Each Lender agrees that notice to it (as provided in the
next sentence) specifying that the Communications have been posted to the
Platform shall constitute effective delivery of the Communications to such
Lender for purposes of the Credit Documents. Each Lender agrees (A) to notify
the Administrative Agent in writing (including by electronic communication) from
time to time of such Lender's e-mail address to which the foregoing notice may
be sent by electronic transmission and (B) that the foregoing notice may be sent
to such e-mail address.

          (b) POSTING. The Borrower further agrees that the Administrative Agent
may make the Communications available to the Lenders by posting the
Communications on Intralinks or a substantially similar electronic transmission
system (the "PLATFORM"), so long as the access to such Platform is limited (i)
to the Agents and the Lenders and (ii) remains subject the confidentiality
requirements set forth in Section 14.16.

          (c) The Platform is provided "as is" and "as available." The Agent
Parties do not warrant the accuracy or completeness of the Communications, or
the adequacy of the platform and expressly disclaim liability for errors or
omissions in the Communications. No warranty of any kind, express, implied or
statutory, including, without limitation, any warranty of merchantability,
fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement of third party rights or
freedom from viruses or other code defects, is made by the Agent Parties in
connection with the Communications or the platform. In no event shall the
Administrative Agent or any of its affiliates or any of their respective
officers, directors, employees, agents, advisors or representatives
(collectively, "AGENT PARTIES") have any liability to the Borrower, any Lender
or any other person or entity for damages of any kind, including, without
limitation, direct or indirect, special, incidental or consequential damages,
losses or expenses (whether in tort, contract or otherwise) arising out of the
Borrower's or the Administrative Agent's transmission of Communications through
the internet, except to the extent the liability of any Agent Party is found in
a final non-appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction to have
resulted primarily from such Agent Party's gross negligence or willful
misconduct.

          14.18. USA PATRIOT ACT. Each Lender hereby notifies Holdings and the
Borrower that pursuant to the requirements of the USA Patriot Act (Title III of
Pub. L. 107-56 (signed into law October 26, 2001)) (the "PATRIOT ACT"), it is
required to obtain, verify and record information that identifies Holdings and
the Borrower, which information includes the name and address of Holdings and
the Borrower and other information that will allow such Lender to identify
Holdings and the Borrower in accordance with the Patriot Act.

          14.19. CONVERSION OF CURRENCIES.

          (a) If, for the purpose of obtaining judgment in any court, it is
necessary to convert a sum owing hereunder in one currency into another
currency, each party hereto agrees, to the fullest extent that it may
effectively do so, that the rate of exchange used shall be that at which in
accordance with normal banking procedures in the relevant jurisdiction the first
currency could be purchased with such other currency on the Business Day
immediately preceding the day on which final judgment is given.

                                      -132-

<PAGE>

          (b) The obligations of the Borrower in respect of any sum due to any
party hereto or any holder of the obligations owing hereunder (the "APPLICABLE
CREDITOR") shall, notwithstanding any judgment in a currency (the "JUDGMENT
CURRENCY") other than the currency in which such sum is stated to be due
hereunder (the "AGREEMENT CURRENCY"), be discharged only to the extent that, on
the Business Day following receipt by the Applicable Creditor of any sum
adjudged to be so due in the Judgment Currency, the Applicable Creditor may in
accordance with normal banking procedures in the relevant jurisdiction purchase
the Agreement Currency with the Judgment Currency; if the amount of the
Agreement Currency so purchased is less than the sum originally due to the
Applicable Creditor in the Agreement Currency, the Borrower agrees, as a
separate obligation and notwithstanding any such judgment, to indemnify the
Applicable Creditor against such loss. The obligations of the Borrower contained
in this Section 14.19 shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the
payment of all other amounts owing hereunder.

          (c) For purposes of this Agreement, the Dollar Equivalent of the
Stated Amount of any Letter of Credit shall be calculated on the date when such
Letter of Credit is issued, on the first Business Day of each month and at such
other times as designated by the Administrative Agent. Such Dollar Equivalent
shall remain in effect until the same is recalculated by the Administrative
Agent as provided above and notice of such recalculation is received by the
Borrower, it being understood that until such notice is received, the Dollar
Equivalent shall be as last reported by the Administrative Agent to the
Borrower. The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower of each
such determination of Dollar Equivalents.

          14.20. ABSTRACT ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF INDEBTEDNESS AND JOINT CREDITORSHIP.

          (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, Intelsat
Global hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees and covenants with the
Administrative Agent by way of an abstract acknowledgement of indebtedness that
it owes to the Administrative Agent as creditor in its own right and not as a
representative of the Secured Parties, sums equal to, and in the currency of,
each and every obligation of Intelsat Global under this Agreement and the other
Credit Documents (the "INTELSAT GLOBAL SECURED OBLIGATIONS"), as and when that
amount falls due for payment. The Administrative Agent shall be the joint
creditor (together with the Secured Parties) of all obligations of Intelsat
Global towards each of the Secured Parties in respect of the Intelsat Global
Secured Obligations.

          (b) Intelsat Global undertakes to pay to the Administrative Agent upon
first written demand after the amount payable by Intelsat Global to each of the
Secured Parties with respect to the Intelsat Global Secured Obligations has
become due and payable.

          (c) The Administrative Agent has the independent right to demand and
receive full or partial payment of the amounts payable by Intelsat Global under
this Section 14.20, irrespective of any discharge of Intelsat Global's
obligation to pay those amounts to the other Secured Parties resulting from
failure by them to take appropriate steps, in insolvency proceedings affecting
Intelsat Global, to preserve their entitlement to be paid those amounts.

          (d) Any amount due and payable by Intelsat Global to the
Administrative Agent under this Section 14.20 shall be decreased to the extent
that the Secured Parties have re-

                                      -133-

<PAGE>

ceived (and are able to retain) payment in full of the corresponding amount in
respect of the Intelsat Global Secured Obligations and any amount due and
payable by Intelsat Global to the Secured Parties under those provisions shall
be decreased to the extent that the Administrative Agent has received (and is
able to retain) payment in full of the corresponding amount under this Section
14.20, PROVIDED that Intelsat Global may not consider its obligations towards a
Secured Party to be so discharged by virtue of any set-off, counterclaim or
similar defence that it may invoke vis-a-vis the Administrative Agent.

          (e) The rights of the Secured Parties (other than the Administrative
Agent) to receive payment of amounts payable by Intelsat Global in respect of
the Intelsat Global Secured Obligations are several and are separate and
independent from, and without prejudice to, the rights of the Administrative
Agent to receive payment under this Section 14.20.

          14.21. CERTAIN COLLATERAL AND GUARANTEE MATTERS.

          (a) The Lenders hereby authorize the Administrative Agent, at its
option and in its discretion, to release any Lien granted to or held by the
Administrative Agent upon any Collateral (i) upon termination of the Commitments
and payment and satisfaction of all of the Obligations at any time arising under
or in respect of this Agreement or the Credit Documents or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby (other than those arising from indemnities for
which no claim has been made), (ii) constituting property being sold or disposed
of (to Persons other than the Borrower and the Guarantors) upon the sale thereof
in compliance with, or as otherwise permitted in connection with a transaction
permitted under, this Agreement or (iii) if approved, authorized or ratified in
writing by the Required Lenders (or all Lenders, if such release is required to
be approved by all of the Lenders hereunder). Upon request by the Administrative
Agent at any time, the Lenders will confirm in writing the Administrative
Agent's authority to release particular types or items of Collateral pursuant to
this Section 14.21.

          (b) Upon any sale and transfer of Collateral which is expressly
permitted pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, or consented to in writing by
the Required Lenders, or all of the Lenders, as applicable, and upon at least
five Business Days' (or such shorter period as is reasonably acceptable to the
Administrative Agent) prior written request by the Borrower, the Administrative
Agent shall (and is hereby irrevocably authorized by the Lenders to) execute
such documents as may be necessary to evidence the release of the Liens granted
to the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Secured Parties herein or
pursuant hereto upon the Collateral that was sold or transferred, provided that
(i) the Administrative Agent shall not be required to execute any such document
on terms which, in the Administrative Agent's reasonable opinion, would expose
the Administrative Agent to liability or create any obligation or entail any
consequence other than the release of such Liens without recourse,
representation or warranty and (ii) such release shall not in any manner
discharge, affect or impair the Obligations or any Liens upon (or obligations of
Holdings or any of its Subsidiaries in respect of) all interests retained by
Holdings or any of its Subsidiaries, including, without limitation, the proceeds
of the sale, all of which shall continue to constitute part of the Collateral.
In the event of any foreclosure or similar enforcement action with respect to
any of the Collateral, the Administrative Agent shall be authorized to deduct
all of the costs and expenses reasonably incurred by the Administrative Agent
from the proceeds of any such sale, transfer or foreclosure.

          SECTION 15. HOLDINGS GUARANTEE.

          15.1. THE HOLDINGS GUARANTEE. In order to induce the Agents and the
Lenders to enter into this Agreement and to extend credit hereunder, to induce
Lenders or any of their respective Affiliates to enter into the Hedge
Agreements, and in recognition of the direct benefits to be received by Holdings
from the proceeds of the Loans, the issuance of the Letters of Credit, and the
entering into of Hedge Agreements, Holdings hereby agrees with the Secured
Parties as follows: Holdings hereby unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees
as primary obligor and not merely as surety the full and prompt payment when
due, whether upon maturity, acceleration or otherwise, of any and all of the
Obligations of the Borrower to the Secured Parties. If any or all of the
Obligations of the Borrower to the Secured Parties becomes due and payable
hereunder, Holdings irrevocably and unconditionally promises to pay such
indebtedness to the Secured Parties, or order, on demand, together with any and
all expenses which may be incurred by the Secured Parties in collecting any of
the Obligations. This Holdings Guarantee is a guaranty of payment and not of
collection. If claim is ever made upon any Secured Party for repayment or
recovery of any amount or amounts received in payment or on account of any of
the Obligations and any of the aforesaid payees repays all or part of said
amount by reason of (i) any judgment, decree or order of any court or
administrative body having jurisdiction over such payee or any of its property
or (ii) any settlement or compromise of any such claim effected in good faith by
such payee with any such claimant (including the Borrower), then and in such
event Holdings agrees that any such judgment, decree, order, settlement or
compromise shall be binding upon it, notwithstanding any revocation of this
Holdings Guarantee or other instrument evidencing any liability of the Borrower,
and Holdings shall be and remain liable to the aforesaid payees hereunder for
the amount so repaid or recovered to the same extent as if such amount had never
originally been received by any such payee.

          15.2. BANKRUPTCY. Additionally, Holdings unconditionally and
irrevocably guarantees the payment of any and all of the Obligations of the
Borrower to the Secured Parties whether or not due or payable by the Borrower
upon the occurrence of an Event of Default under Section 12.5, and
unconditionally promises to pay such indebtedness to the Secured Parties, or
order, on demand, in lawful money of the United States.

          15.3. NATURE OF LIABILITY.

          (a) The liability of Holdings hereunder is exclusive and independent
of any security for or other guaranty of the Obligations of the Borrower whether
executed by any other guarantor or by any other party, and the liability of
Holdings hereunder shall not be affected or impaired by (i) any direction as to
application of payment by the Borrower or by any other party, or (ii) any other
continuing or other guaranty, undertaking or maximum liability of a guarantor or
of any other party as to the Obligations of the Borrower, or (iii) any payment
on or in reduction of any such other guaranty or undertaking, or (iv) any
dissolution, termination or increase, decrease or change in personnel by the
Borrower, or (v) any payment made to any Secured Party on the Obligations which
any such Secured Party repays to the Borrower pursuant to court order in any
bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, moratorium or other debtor relief
proceeding, and Holdings waives any right to the deferral or modification of its
obligations hereunder by reason

                                      -135-

<PAGE>

of any such proceeding, or (vi) the lack of validity or enforceability of any
Credit Document or any instrument relating thereto.

          (b) The liability of Holdings shall not be affected nor shall this
Holdings Guarantee be discharged or reduced by reason of:

          (i) the incapacity or any change in the name, style or constitution of
     the Borrower or any other person liable;

          (ii) the Administrative Agent granting any time, indulgence or
     concession to, or compounding with, discharging, releasing or varying the
     liability of, the Borrower or any other person liable or renewing,
     determining, varying or increasing any accommodation, facility or
     transaction or otherwise dealing with the same in any manner whatsoever or
     concurring in, accepting or varying any compromise, arrangement or
     settlement or omitting to claim or enforce payment from the Borrower or any
     other person liable;

          (iii) any novation of any Credit Document (including, without
     limitation, any novation arising on the amalgamation of companies); or

          (iv) any act or omission which would not have discharged or affected
     the liability of Holdings had it been a principal debtor instead of a
     guarantor or by anything done or omitted which but for this provision might
     operate to exonerate or discharge Holdings.

          15.4. INDEPENDENT OBLIGATIONS. The obligations of Holdings hereunder
are independent of the obligations of any other guarantor, any other party or
the Borrower, and a separate action or actions may be brought and prosecuted
against Holdings whether or not action is brought against any other guarantor,
any other party or the Borrower and whether or not any other guarantor, any
other party or the Borrower be joined in any such action or actions. Holdings
waives, to the full extent permitted by law, the benefit of any statute of
limitations affecting its liability hereunder or the enforcement thereof. Any
payment by the Borrower or other circumstance which operates to toll any statute
of limitations as to the Borrower shall operate to toll the statute of
limitations as to Holdings.

          15.5. AUTHORIZATION. Holdings authorizes the Secured Parties without
notice or demand (except as shall be required by applicable statute and cannot
be waived), and without affecting or impairing its liability hereunder, from
time to time to:

          (a) change the manner, place or terms of payment of, and/or change or
     extend the time of payment of, renew, increase, accelerate or alter, any of
     the Obligations (including any increase or decrease in the rate of interest
     thereon), any security therefor, or any liability incurred directly or
     indirectly in respect thereof, and the Holdings Guarantee herein made shall
     apply to the Obligations as so changed, extended, renewed or altered;

          (b) take and hold security for the payment of the Obligations and
     sell, exchange, release, surrender, realize upon or otherwise deal with in
     any manner and in any order any property by whomsoever at any time pledged
     or mortgaged to secure, or how-

                                      -136-

<PAGE>

     soever securing, the Obligations or any liabilities (including any of those
     hereunder) incurred directly or indirectly in respect thereof or hereof,
     and/or any offset there against;

          (c) exercise or refrain from exercising any rights against the
     Borrower, any other Credit Party or others or otherwise act or refrain from
     acting;

          (d) release or substitute any one or more endorsers, guarantors, the
     Borrower or other obligors;

          (e) settle or compromise any of the Obligations, any security therefor
     or any liability (including any of those hereunder) incurred directly or
     indirectly in respect thereof or hereof, and may subordinate the payment of
     all or any part thereof to the payment of any liability (whether due or
     not) of the Borrower to its creditors other than the Secured Parties;

          (f) apply any sums by whomsoever paid or howsoever realized to any
     liability or liabilities of the Borrower to the Secured Parties regardless
     of what liability or liabilities of Holdings or the Borrower remain unpaid;

          (g) consent to or waive any breach of, or any act, omission or default
     under, this Agreement or any of the instruments or agreements referred to
     herein, or otherwise amend, modify or supplement this Agreement or any of
     such other instruments or agreements;

          (h) take any other action which would, under otherwise applicable
     principles of common law, give rise to a legal or equitable discharge of
     Holdings from its liabilities under this Holdings Guarantee;

          (i) release any collateral security for the Obligations; and/or

          (j) change its corporate structure.

          15.6. RELIANCE. It is not necessary for any Secured Party to inquire
into the capacity or powers of the Borrower or the officers, directors, partners
or agents acting or purporting to act on their behalf, and any Obligations made
or created in reliance upon the professed exercise of such powers shall be
guaranteed hereunder.

          15.7. SUBORDINATION. Any of the indebtedness of the Borrower now or
hereafter owing to Holdings is hereby subordinated to the Obligations of the
Borrower owing to the Secured Parties; and if the Administrative Agent so
requests at a time when an Event of Default exists, all such indebtedness of the
Borrower to Holdings shall be collected, enforced and received by Holdings for
the benefit of the Secured Parties and be paid over to the Administrative Agent
on behalf of the Secured Parties on account of the Obligations of the Borrower
to the Secured Parties, but without affecting or impairing in any manner the
liability of Holdings under the other provisions of this Holdings Guarantee.
Prior to the transfer by Holdings of any note or negotiable instrument
evidencing any of the indebtedness of the Borrower to Holdings, Holdings shall
mark such note or negotiable instrument with a legend that the same is subject
to this sub-

                                      -137-

<PAGE>

ordination. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Holdings hereby
agrees with the Secured Parties that it will not exercise any right of
subrogation which it may at any time otherwise have as a result of this Holdings
Guarantee (whether contractual, under Section 509 of the Bankruptcy Code or
otherwise) until all Obligations have been irrevocably paid in full in cash.

          15.8. WAIVERS.

          (a) Holdings waives any right (except as shall be required by
applicable statute and cannot be waived) to require any Secured Party to (i)
proceed against the Borrower, any other guarantor or any other party, (ii)
proceed against or exhaust any security held from the Borrower, any other
guarantor or any other party or (iii) pursue any other remedy in any Secured
Party's power whatsoever. Holdings waives any defense based on or arising out of
any defense of the Borrower, any other guarantor or any other party, other than
payment in full of the Obligations, based on or arising out of the disability of
the Borrower, any other guarantor or any other party, or the validity, legality
or unenforceability of the Obligations or any part thereof from any cause, or
the cessation from any cause of the liability of the Borrower other than payment
in full of the Obligations. The Secured Parties may, at their election,
foreclose on any security held by any Agent, the Collateral Agent or any other
Secured Party by one or more judicial or nonjudicial sales, whether or not every
aspect of any such sale is commercially reasonable (to the extent such sale is
permitted by applicable law), or exercise any other right or remedy the Secured
Parties may have against the Borrower or any other party, or any security,
without affecting or impairing in any way the liability of Holdings hereunder
except to the extent the Obligations have been paid. Holdings waives any defense
arising out of any such election by the Secured Parties, even though such
election operates to impair or extinguish any right of reimbursement or
subrogation or other right or remedy of Holdings against the Borrower or any
other party or any security.

          (b) Holdings waives all presentments, demands for performance,
protests and notices, including, without limitation, notices of nonperformance,
notices of protest, notices of dishonor, notices of acceptance of this Holdings
Guarantee, and notices of the existence, creation or incurring of new or
additional Obligations. Holdings assumes all responsibility for being and
keeping itself informed of the Borrower's financial condition and assets, and of
all other circumstances bearing upon the risk of nonpayment of the Obligations
and the nature, scope and extent of the risks which Holdings assumes and incurs
hereunder, and agrees that neither the Agents nor any Lender shall have any duty
to advise Holdings of information known to them regarding such circumstances or
risks.

          (c) Holdings warrants and agrees that each of the waivers set forth
above is made with full knowledge of its significance and consequences and that
if any of such waivers are determined to be contrary to any applicable law or
public policy, such waivers shall be effective only to the maximum extent
permitted by law.

          15.9. MAXIMUM LIABILITY. It is the desire and intent of Holdings and
the Secured Parties that this Holdings Guarantee shall be enforced against
Holdings to the fullest extent permissible under the laws and public policies
applied in each jurisdiction in which enforcement is sought. If, however, and to
the extent that, the obligations of Holdings under this Holdings Guarantee shall
be adjudicated to be invalid or unenforceable for any reason (including, without

                                      -138-

limitation, because of any applicable state or federal law relating to
fraudulent conveyances or transfers), then the amount of the Obligations of
Holdings shall be deemed to be reduced and Holdings shall pay the maximum amount
of the Obligations which would be permissible under applicable law.

          15.10. HOLDINGS GUARANTEE RELEASE. Upon the consummation of any
Holdings Dropdown Transaction or Holdings-Borrower Merger, the parties hereto
agree that Predecessor Holdings or Pre-Merger Holdings (as applicable) shall be
released from the Holdings Guarantee and from all other covenants and
obligations of Holdings under this agreement and the Administrative Agent shall,
at Borrower's expense, take all actions reasonably requested by Borrower or
Predecessor Holdings to evidence such release; PROVIDED that Successor Holdings
or Replacement Holdings (as applicable) shall guarantee the Obligations and
shall otherwise assume and succeed to the obligations of Holdings hereunder, all
in a manner reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.

          SECTION 16. CONDITION SUBSEQUENT. It shall be a condition subsequent
to the effectiveness of this Agreement that Holdings pledge all of the capital
stock of the Borrower to the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Secured
Parties and that the Acquisition occur, in each case on the Closing Date,
pursuant to the Bermuda Pledge Agreement and the Acquisition Agreement,
respectively.

          It is hereby acknowledged that, upon the instant of effectiveness of
this Agreement, Holdings does not own the capital stock of the Borrower and the
Acquisition will not have occurred, but Holdings shall become the owner of such
capital stock and the Acquisition shall occur contemporaneously with the
effectiveness hereof. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement or any other Credit Document, so long as Holdings so becomes the owner
of the capital stock of the Borrower and fulfills the condition subsequent set
forth in this Section 16 and the Acquisition so occurs, the failure of Holdings
to own the capital stock of Borrower (and to pledge such capital stock) and the
pendancy of the Acquisition upon the instant of effectiveness shall not
constitute a Default or an Event of Default, a breach of any representation or
warranty or a failure to satisfy any condition precedent under this Agreement or
any other Credit Document.

          IN WITNESS WHEREOF, each of the parties hereto has caused a

first above written.
