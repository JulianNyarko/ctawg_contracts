Commission; and (2)&nbsp;a lower payment would have been made to the Covered Participant based upon the restated financial results, upon the recommendation of the Compensation Committee, the Board may, in its discretion, require such Covered
Participant to repay all or a portion of the difference between the payment received by the Covered Participant and the payment which would have been paid to the Covered Participant based on the restated financials (such difference being referred to
as the &#147;Recoupment Amount&#148;). In order to collect the Recoupment Amount, the Board may require the Covered Participant to forfeit all or a portion of any unvested restricted stock issued in respect of Awards hereunder, in an amount not to
exceed the Recoupment Amount. The Company&#146;s right to require repayment or forfeiture set forth in this Section&nbsp;7(i) shall apply only if the facts leading to a determination that a restatement is required are discovered within the three
(3)&nbsp;fiscal years following the fiscal year with respect to which the Covered Participant is paid an Award hereunder. The Recoupment Amount shall be determined by the Board in its good faith discretion and without regard to any deferral of
Awards hereunder. The Committee may require any Covered Participant to execute an acknowledgement of the applicability of this Section&nbsp;7(i) and an agreement to comply with its provisions, in such form as the Committee may determine, as a
condition to the receipt of any payment under the Plan. </P>
