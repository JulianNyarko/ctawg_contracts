           (x),

               (B) the sale (other than to the Borrower or a Restricted

           Unrestricted Subsidiary, PLUS

           (6) in the event any Unrestricted Subsidiary of the Borrower has been
     redesignated as a Restricted Subsidiary or has been merged, consolidated or
     amalgamated with or into, or transfers or conveys its assets to, or is
     liquidated into, the Borrower or a Restricted Subsidiary of the Borrower,

     sentence) of the Investments of the Borrower in such Unrestricted
     Subsidiary at the time of such redesignation, combination or transfer (or
     of the assets transferred or conveyed, as applicable) (other than in each
     case to the extent that the designation of such Subsidiary as an
     Unrestricted Subsidiary was made pursuant to Section 10.2(b)(vii) or (x) or
     constituted a Permitted Investment).

The Fair Market Value of property other than cash covered by clauses (2), (3),
(4), (5) and (6) above shall be determined in good faith by the Borrower and

               (A) in the event of property with a Fair Market Value in excess
           of $50.0 million, shall be set forth in an Officers' Certificate or

               (B) in the event of property with a Fair Market Value in excess
           of $100.0 million, shall be set forth in a resolution approved by at
           least a majority of the Board of Directors of the Borrower.

           "CUMULATIVE INTEREST EXPENSE" shall mean, in respect of any
Restricted Payment, the sum of the aggregate amount of Consolidated Interest
Expense of the Borrower and the Restricted Subsidiaries for the period from and
after January 1, 2005 to the end of the Borrower's



                                       -14-
<PAGE>

most recently ended fiscal quarter for which internal financial statements are
available and immediately preceding the proposed Restricted Payment.

           "DEBT TO ADJUSTED EBITDA RATIO" shall mean, with respect to any
Person for any period, the ratio of (i) Consolidated Total Indebtedness as of
the date of calculation (the "CALCULATION DATE") to (ii) Adjusted EBITDA of such
Person for the four consecutive fiscal quarters immediately preceding such
Calculation Date. In the event that such Person or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries Incurs or redeems any Indebtedness (other than in the case of
revolving credit borrowings, in which case interest expense shall be computed
based upon the average daily balance of such Indebtedness during the applicable
period) or issues or redeems Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock subsequent to
the commencement of the period for which the Debt to Adjusted EBITDA Ratio is
being calculated but prior to the Calculation Date, then the Debt to Adjusted
EBITDA Ratio shall be calculated giving pro forma effect to such Incurrence or
redemption of Indebtedness, or such issuance or redemption of Disqualified Stock
or Preferred Stock, as if the same had occurred at the beginning of the
applicable four-quarter period.

           For purposes of making the computation referred to above,
Investments, acquisitions, dispositions, mergers, amalgamations, consolidations
and discontinued operations (as determined in accordance with GAAP), in each
case with respect to an operating unit of a business, and other operational
changes that such Person or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries has both
determined to make and made after January 28, 2005 and during the four-quarter
reference period or subsequent to such reference period and on or prior to or
simultaneously with the Calculation Date shall be calculated on a pro forma
basis assuming that all such Investments, acquisitions, dispositions, mergers,
amalgamations, consolidations, discontinued operations and other operational
changes (and the change of any associated fixed charge obligations and the
change in Adjusted EBITDA resulting therefrom) had occurred on the first day of
the four-quarter reference period. If since the beginning of such period any
Person that subsequently became a Restricted Subsidiary or was merged with or
into such Person or any Restricted Subsidiary since the beginning of such period
shall have made any Investment, acquisition, disposition, merger, amalgamation,
consolidation, discontinued operation or operational change, in each case with
respect to an operating unit of a business, that would have required adjustment
pursuant to this definition, then the Debt to Adjusted EBITDA Ratio shall be
calculated giving pro forma effect thereto for such period as if such
Investment, acquisition, disposition, discontinued operation, merger,
amalgamation, consolidation or operational change had occurred at the beginning
of the applicable four-quarter period.

           For purposes of this definition, whenever pro forma effect is to be
given to any transaction, the pro forma calculations shall be made in good faith
by a responsible financial or accounting officer of the Borrower. If any
Indebtedness bears a floating rate of interest and is being given pro forma
effect, the interest on such Indebtedness shall be calculated as if the rate in
effect on the Calculation Date had been the applicable rate for the entire
period (taking into account any Hedging Obligations applicable to such
Indebtedness if such Hedging Obligation has a remaining term in excess of 12
months). Interest on a Capitalized Lease Obligation shall be deemed to accrue at
an interest rate reasonably determined by a responsible financial or accounting
officer of the Borrower to be the rate of interest implicit in such Capitalized
Lease Obligation in accordance with GAAP. For purposes of making the computation
referred to above, interest



                                       -15-
<PAGE>

on any Indebtedness under a revolving credit facility computed on a pro forma
basis shall be computed based upon the average daily balance of such
Indebtedness during the applicable period. Interest on Indebtedness that may
optionally be determined at an interest rate based upon a factor of a prime or
similar rate, a eurocurrency interbank offered rate, or other rate, shall be
deemed to have been based upon the rate actually chosen, or, if none, then based
upon such optional rate chosen as the Borrower may designate. Any such pro forma
calculation may include adjustments appropriate, in the reasonable determination
of the Borrower as set forth in an Officers' Certificate, to reflect, among
other things, (1) operating expense reductions and other operating improvements
or synergies reasonably expected to result from any acquisition, amalgamation,
merger or operational change (including, to the extent applicable, from the
Transactions) and (2) all adjustments used in connection with the calculation of
"Adjusted EBITDA" as set forth in footnote 4 to the "Summary Historical and Pro
Forma Consolidated Financial Data" under "Offering Memorandum Summary" in the
Offering Memorandum to the extent such adjustments, without duplication,
continue to be applicable to such four-quarter period.

           "DEFAULT" shall mean any event which is, or after notice or passage
of time, or both, would be an Event of Default.

           "DEFAULTING LENDER" shall mean any Lender with respect to which a

Designated Non-cash Consideration pursuant to an Officers' Certificate, setting
forth the basis of such valuation, less the amount of Cash Equivalents received
in connection with a subsequent sale of such Designated Non-cash Consideration.

           "DESIGNATED PREFERRED STOCK" shall mean Preferred Stock of the
Borrower, its Restricted Subsidiaries or any Parent of the Borrower or its
Restricted Subsidiaries, as applicable (other than Disqualified Stock), that is
issued for cash (other than to the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or an
employee stock ownership plan or trust established by the Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries) and is so designated as Designated Preferred Stock, pursuant to an
Officers' Certificate, on the issuance date thereof, the cash proceeds of which
are excluded from the calculation set forth in the definition of "Cumulative
Credit."

           "DISQUALIFIED STOCK" shall mean, with respect to any Person, any
Capital Stock of such Person which, by its terms (or by the terms of any
security into which it is convertible or for which it is redeemable or
exchangeable), or upon the happening of any event:

           (1) matures or is mandatorily redeemable, pursuant to a sinking fund
     obligation or otherwise (other than as a result of a change of control or
     asset sale; PROVIDED that the relevant asset sale or change of control
     provisions, taken as a whole, are no more favorable in any material respect
     to holders of such Capital Stock than the asset sale and change of control
     provisions applicable to the Exchange Notes and any purchase requirement
     triggered thereby may not become operative until compliance with the asset
     sale and change of control provisions applicable to the Exchange Notes
     (including the purchase of any notes tendered pursuant thereto)),

     Stock, or

           (3) is redeemable at the option of the holder thereof, in whole or in
     part, in each case prior to 91 days after the maturity date of the Exchange
     Notes;

PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that only the portion of Capital Stock which so matures or is
mandatorily redeemable, is so convertible or exchangeable or is so redeemable at
the option of the holder thereof prior to such date shall be deemed to be
Disqualified Stock; PROVIDED, FURTHER, HOWEVER, that if such Capital Stock is
issued to any employee or to any plan for the benefit of employees of the
Borrower or its Subsidiaries or by any such plan to such employees, such Capital
Stock shall not constitute Disqualified Stock solely because it may be required
to be repurchased by the Borrower in order to satisfy applicable statutory or
regulatory obligations or as a result of such employee's termination, death or
disability; PROVIDED, FURTHER, that any class of Capital Stock of such Person
that by its terms authorizes such Person to satisfy its obligations thereunder
by delivery of Capital Stock that is not Disqualified Stock shall not be deemed
to be Disqualified Stock.

           "DOLLAR EQUIVALENT" shall mean, on any date of determination, (a)

any embedded derivatives created by the terms of such Indebtedness; and any such
amounts that would have constituted Indebtedness under this Agreement but for
the application of this sentence shall not be deemed an Incurrence of

                                       -46-
<PAGE>

           (a) Subject to and upon the terms and conditions herein set forth,
each Lender having a Commitment severally agrees to make a loan or loans (each a
"LOAN") on the Closing Date to the Borrower in Dollars, which Loans shall not
exceed for any such Lender the respective Commitment of such Lender and in the
aggregate shall not exceed $600,000,000.

           Such Loans (i) shall be made on the Closing Date, (ii) except as set
forth herein, shall be incurred and maintained as LIBOR Loans, (iii) may be
repaid or prepaid in accordance with the provisions hereof, but once repaid or
prepaid, may not be reborrowed, (iv) shall not exceed for any such Lender the
Commitment of such Lender and (v) shall not exceed in the aggregate the total of
all Commitments. On the Initial Maturity Date, all then unpaid Loans shall
either (x) be repaid in full or (y) be exchanged for Exchange Notes in
accordance with Section 2.1(b). Upon any such repayment in full or exchange
pursuant to this Section 2.1, this Agreement shall be of no further force or
effect (other than any fees payable pursuant to Section 4.1).

           (b) (i) Subject to satisfaction of the provisions of this Section
2.1(b) on the Initial Maturity Date, each Loan, to the extent not repaid, will
be exchanged for Exchange Notes in an aggregate principal amount equal to such
Lender's Loans outstanding on the Initial Maturity Date. The Exchange Notes
shall be governed by the Exchange Note Indenture. Upon issuance of the Exchange
Notes, any Notes representing Loans delivered hereunder shall be canceled by the
Borrower and the corresponding amount of the Loans deemed repaid. The Borrower
shall have appointed a trustee for the Exchange Notes (and to which the majority
of holders of Loans shall not have reasonably objected prior to the Initial
Maturity Date) and entered into the Exchange Note Indenture and the Registration
Rights Agreement, and in each case shall comply with the terms and conditions in
each such agreement.

           (ii) On the Initial Maturity Date, the exchange of Loans to Exchange
Notes shall be subject to the following conditions: (A) no Event of Default
shall have occurred and be continuing under Section 12.1(e) or Section 12.1(f)
of this Agreement relating to the Borrower; (B) all fees then due to the
Arrangers and the Lenders pursuant to Section 4.1 and presented for payment
shall have been paid in full: and (C) no order, decree, injunction or judgment
enjoining any such refinancing shall be in effect. If an Event of Default under
Section 12.1(e) or Section 12.1(f) of this Agreement shall have occurred and be
continuing on the date of such exchange, any notices given or cure periods
commenced while the Loans were outstanding shall be deemed given or commenced
(as of the actual dates thereof) for all purposes with respect to the Exchange
Notes (with the same effect as if the Exchange Notes had been outstanding as of
the actual dates thereof).

           2.2. MINIMUM AMOUNT OF EACH BORROWING. The aggregate principal amount
of the Borrowing of Loans shall be in a multiple of $1,000,000.

           2.3. NOTICE OF BORROWING.

           (a) The Borrower shall give the Administrative Agent at the
Administrative Agent's Office prior to 12:00 Noon (New York City time) at least
one Business Day prior written notice (or telephonic notice) of the Borrowing of
Loans. Such notice (a "NOTICE OF BORROWING") shall be irrevocable and shall
specify (i) the aggregate principal amount of the Loans to be made, (ii) the
date of the Borrowing (which shall be the Closing Date) and (iii) the Interest
Pe-



                                       -47-
<PAGE>

riod to be initially applicable thereto. The Administrative Agent shall
promptly give each Lender written notice (or telephonic notice promptly
confirmed in writing) of the proposed Borrowing of Loans, of such Lender's
proportionate share thereof and of the other matters covered by the related
Notice of Borrowing.

           (b) Without in any way limiting the obligation of the Borrower to
confirm in writing any notice it may give hereunder by telephone, the
Administrative Agent may act prior to receipt of written confirmation without
liability upon the basis of such telephonic notice believed by the
Administrative Agent in good faith to be from an Authorized Officer of the
Borrower. In each such case, the Borrower hereby waives the right to dispute the
Administrative Agent's record of the terms of any such telephonic notice.

           2.4. DISBURSEMENT OF FUNDS.

           (a) Subject to Section 6, no later than 9:00 a.m. (New York City
time) on the Closing Date, each Lender will make available its PRO RATA portion
based on its Commitment, if any, of each Borrowing requested to be made on such
date in the manner provided below.

           (b) Each Lender shall make available all amounts it is to fund to the
Borrower in immediately available funds to the Administrative Agent at the
Administrative Agent's Office and the Administrative Agent will make available
to the Borrower, by depositing to the Borrower's account at the Administrative
Agent's Office the aggregate of the amounts so made available in Dollars. Unless
the Administrative Agent shall have been notified by any Lender prior to the
Closing Date that such Lender does not intend to make available to the
Administrative Agent its portion of the Borrowing to be made on such date, the
Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such amount available
to the Administrative Agent on such date, and the Administrative Agent, in
reliance upon such assumption, may (in its sole discretion and without any
obligation to do so) make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount. If
such corresponding amount is not in fact made available to the Administrative
Agent by such Lender and the Administrative Agent has made available same to the
Borrower, the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to recover such
corresponding amount from such Lender. If such Lender does not pay such
corresponding amount forthwith upon the Administrative Agent's demand therefor
the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower and the Borrower
shall immediately pay such corresponding amount to the Administrative Agent. The
Administrative Agent shall also be entitled to recover from such Lender or the
Borrower interest on such corresponding amount in respect of each day from the
date such corresponding amount was made available by the Administrative Agent to
the Borrower to the date such corresponding amount is recovered by the
Administrative Agent, at a rate PER ANNUM equal to (i) if paid by such Lender,
the Federal Funds Effective Rate or (ii) if paid by the Borrower, the
then-applicable rate of interest or fees, calculated in accordance with Section
2.8, for the respective Loans.

           (c) Nothing in this Section 2.4 shall be deemed to relieve any Lender
from its obligation to fulfill its commitments hereunder or to prejudice any
rights that the Borrower may have against any Lender as a result of any default
by such Lender hereunder (it being understood, however, that no Lender shall be
responsible for the failure of any other Lender to fulfill its commitments
hereunder).

           2.5. REPAYMENT OF LOANS; EVIDENCE OF DEBT.

           (a) Subject to Section 2.1, the Borrower shall repay to the
Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Lenders, on the Initial Maturity
Date, the then-unpaid Loans, in Dollars.

           (b) [INTENTIONALLY OMITTED]

           (c) Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice
an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of the Borrower to the
appropriate lending office of such Lender resulting from each Loan made by such
lending office of such Lender from time to time, including the amounts of
principal and interest payable and paid to such lending office of such Lender
from time to time under this Agreement.

           (d) The Administrative Agent shall maintain the Register pursuant to
Section 14.6(b), and a subaccount for each Lender, in which Register and
subaccounts (taken together) shall be recorded (i) the amount of each Loan made
hereunder and the Interest Period applicable thereto, (ii) the amount of any
principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable from the
Borrower to each Lender hereunder and (iii) the amount of any sum received by
the Administrative Agent hereunder from the Borrower and each Lender's share
thereof.

           (e) The entries made in the Register and accounts and subaccounts
maintained pursuant to paragraphs (d) and (e) of this Section 2.5 shall, to the
extent permitted by applicable law, be prima facie evidence of the existence and
amounts of the obligations of the Borrower therein recorded; PROVIDED, HOWEVER,
that the failure of any Lender or the Administrative Agent to maintain such
account, such Register or such subaccount, as applicable, or any error therein,
shall not in any manner affect the obligation of the Borrower to repay (with
applicable interest) the Loans made to the Borrower by such Lender in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement.

           2.6. CONTINUATIONS. The Borrower shall have the option on any
Business Day to continue the outstanding principal amount of any LIBOR Loans as
LIBOR Loans for an additional Interest Period, which Interest Period shall, at
the option of the Borrower be a one or three month period, provided that any
Interest Period may be for a period of less than one month if agreed by the
Borrower and the Administrative Agent (and shall be agreed if a one or three
month period would otherwise violate clause (c) of Section 2.9). Each such
continuation shall be effected by the Borrower by giving the Administrative
Agent at the Administrative Agent's Office prior to 12:00 Noon (New York City
time) at least three Business Days' prior written notice (or telephonic notice
promptly confirmed in writing) (each, a "NOTICE OF CONTINUATION") specifying the
Loans to be so continued and the Interest Period to be initially applicable
thereto. The Administrative Agent shall give each Lender notice as promptly as
practicable of any such proposed continuation affecting any of its Loans.
Failure to deliver a Notice of Continuation shall result in an Interest Period
that is the same as with respect to any LIBOR Loans then outstanding.

           2.7. PRO RATA BORROWINGS. Each Borrowing of Loans under this
Agreement shall be granted by the Lenders PRO RATA on the basis of their
then-applicable Commitments. It is understood that no Lender shall be
responsible for any default by any other Lender in its obliga-



                                       -49-

tion to make Loans hereunder and that each Lender shall be obligated to make the
Loans provided to be made by it hereunder, regardless of the failure of any
other Lender to fulfill its commitments hereunder.

           2.8. INTEREST.

           (a) The unpaid principal amount of each Loan shall bear interest from
the date of the Borrowing thereof until maturity thereof (whether by
acceleration or otherwise) at a rate PER ANNUM that shall at all times (other
than as specified in Section 2.8 or Section 2.10) be the LIBOR Margin in effect
from time to time plus the relevant LIBOR Rate; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, in no event
shall the interest rate exceed 11.25% PER annum.

           (b) If all or a portion of (i) the principal amount of any Loan or
(ii) any interest payable thereon shall not be paid when due (whether at the
stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise), such overdue amount shall bear
interest at a rate PER ANNUM that is (x) in the case of overdue principal, the
rate that would otherwise be applicable thereto PLUS 2% or (y) in the case of
any overdue interest, to the extent permitted by applicable law, the rate
described in Section 2.8(a) PLUS 2% from and including the date of such
non-payment to but excluding the date on which such amount is paid in full
(after as well as before judgment).

           (c) Interest on each Loan shall accrue from and including the Closing
Date to but excluding the date of any repayment thereof and shall be payable on
the last day of each Interest Period applicable thereto and upon any prepayment
(on the amount prepaid), at maturity (whether by acceleration or otherwise) and,
after such maturity, on demand.

           (d) All computations of interest hereunder shall be made in
accordance with Section 5.5.

           (e) The Administrative Agent, upon determining the interest rate for
any Borrowing of LIBOR Loans, shall promptly notify the Borrower and the
relevant Lenders thereof. Each such determination shall, absent clearly
demonstrable error, be final and conclusive and binding on all parties hereto.

           (f) To the extent that the LIBOR Rate shall be unavailable, the
Borrower and the Administrative Agent shall agree in good faith to find a
comparable rate for the Loans based upon the most recently available LIBOR Rate
(including, without limitation, as "ABR Loans" as provided in the Intelsat
Credit Agreement).

           2.9. INTEREST PERIODS.

           Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained above:

           (a) the initial Interest Period for any Borrowing of LIBOR Loans
     shall commence on the date of such Borrowing and each Interest Period
     occurring thereafter in respect of such Borrowing shall commence on the day
     on which the next preceding Interest Period expires;



                                       -50-
<PAGE>

           (b) if any Interest Period would otherwise expire on a day that is
     not a Business Day, such Interest Period shall expire on the next
     succeeding Business Day, PROVIDED that if any Interest Period in respect of
     a LIBOR Loan would otherwise expire on a day that is not a Business Day but
     is a day of the month after which no further Business Day occurs in such
     month, such Interest Period shall expire on the next preceding Business
     Day;

           (c) the Borrower shall not be entitled to elect any Interest Period
     in respect of any LIBOR Loan if such Interest Period would extend beyond
     the Initial Maturity Date; and

           (d) in lieu of making any payment permitted or required under this
     Agreement in respect of any LIBOR Loan other than on the last day of the
     Interest Period therefor so long as no Default or Event of Default shall
     have occurred and be continuing, the Borrower at its option may deposit
     with the Administrative Agent an amount equal to the amount of the LIBOR
     Loan to be prepaid and such LIBOR Loan shall be repaid on the last day of
     the Interest Period therefor in the required amount. Such deposit shall be
     held by the Administrative Agent in a corporate time deposit account
     established on terms reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent,
     earning interest at the then-customary rate for accounts of such type. Such
     deposit shall constitute cash collateral for the Obligations, PROVIDED that
     the Borrower may at any time direct that such deposit be applied to make
     the applicable payment required pursuant to this Section 2.9.

           2.10. INCREASED COSTS, ILLEGALITY, ETC.

           (a) In the event that (x) in the case of clause (i) below, the
Administrative Agent or (y) in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii) below, any
Lender shall have reasonably determined (which determination shall, absent
clearly demonstrable error, be final and conclusive and binding upon all parties
hereto):

           (i) on any date for determining the LIBOR Rate for any Interest
     Period that (x) deposits in the principal amounts of the Loans comprising
     such LIBOR Borrowing are not generally available in the relevant market or
     (y) by reason of any changes arising on or after the Closing Date affecting
     the interbank LIBOR market, adequate and fair means do not exist for
     ascertaining the applicable interest rate on the basis provided for in the
     definition of LIBOR Rate; or

           (ii) at any time, that such Lender shall incur increased costs or
     reductions in the amounts received or receivable hereunder with respect to
     any LIBOR Loans (other than any such increase or reduction attributable to
     Taxes) because of (x) any change since the Closing Date in any applicable
     law, governmental rule, regulation, guideline or order (or in the
     interpretation or administration thereof and including the introduction of
     any new law or governmental rule, regulation, guideline or order), such as,
     for example, without limitation, a change in official reserve requirements,
     and/or (y) other circumstances affecting the interbank LIBOR market or the
     position of such Lender in such market; or



                                       -51-
<PAGE>

           (iii) at any time, that the making or continuance of any LIBOR Loan
     has become unlawful by compliance by such Lender in good faith with any
     law, governmental rule, regulation, guideline or order (or would conflict
     with any such governmental rule, regulation, guideline or order not having
     the force of law even though the failure to comply therewith would not be
     unlawful), or has become impracticable as a result of a contingency
     occurring after the Closing Date that materially and adversely affects the
     interbank LIBOR market;

then, and in any such event, such Lender (or the Administrative Agent, in the
case of clause (i) above) shall within a reasonable time thereafter give notice
(if by telephone, confirmed in writing) to the Borrower and to the
Administrative Agent of such determination (which notice the Administrative
Agent shall promptly transmit to each of the other Lenders). Thereafter (x) in
the case of clause (i) above, LIBOR Loans shall no longer be available until
such time as the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower and the Lenders that
the circumstances giving rise to such notice by the Administrative Agent no
longer exist (which notice the Administrative Agent agrees to give at such time
when such circumstances no longer exist), (y) in the case of clause (ii) above,
the Borrower shall pay to such Lender, promptly after receipt of written demand
therefor such additional amounts (in the form of an increased rate of, or a
different method of calculating, interest or otherwise as such Lender in its
reasonable discretion shall determine) as shall be required to compensate such
Lender for such increased costs or reductions in amounts receivable hereunder
(it being agreed that a written notice as to the additional amounts owed to such
Lender, showing in reasonable detail the basis for the calculation thereof,
submitted to the Borrower by such Lender shall, absent clearly demonstrable
error, be final and conclusive and binding upon all parties hereto) and (z) in
the case of clause (iii) above, the Borrower shall take one of the actions
specified in Section 2.10(b) as promptly as possible and, in any event, within
the time period required by law. To the extent that the LIBOR Rate shall be
unavailable due to, or any Lender shall experience increased costs or reduced
receipts per, the circumstances described above, the Borrower and the
Administrative Agent shall agree in good faith to find a comparable rate for the
Loans based upon the most recently available LIBOR Rate (including, without
limitation, as "ABR Loans" as provided in the Intelsat Credit Agreement).

           (b) If, after the Closing Date, the adoption of any applicable law,
rule or regulation regarding capital adequacy, or any change therein, or any
change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any governmental
authority, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, central bank or
comparable agency charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or
compliance by a Lender or its parent with any request or directive made or
adopted after the Closing Date regarding capital adequacy (whether or not having
the force of law) of any such authority, association, central bank or comparable
agency, has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such
Lender's or its parent's or its Affiliate's capital or assets as a consequence
of such Lender's commitments or obligations hereunder to a level below that
which such Lender or its parent or its Affiliate could have achieved but for
such adoption, effectiveness, change or compliance (taking into consideration
such Lender's or its parent's policies with respect to capital adequacy), then
from time to time, promptly after demand by such Lender (with a copy to the
Administrative Agent), the Borrower shall pay to such Lender such additional
amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or its parent for such
reduction, it being understood and agreed, however, that a Lender shall not be
entitled to such com-



                                       -52-
<PAGE>

pensation as a result of such Lender's compliance with, or pursuant to any
request or directive to comply with, any such law, rule or regulation as in
effect on the Closing Date. Each Lender, upon determining in good faith that any
additional amounts will be payable pursuant to this Section 2.10(b), will give
prompt written notice thereof to the Borrower which notice shall set forth in
reasonable detail the basis of the calculation of such additional amounts,
although the failure to give any such notice shall not, subject to Section 2.13,
release or diminish the Borrower's obligations to pay additional amounts
pursuant to this Section 2.10(b) upon receipt of such notice. To the extent that
the LIBOR Rate shall be unavailable due to, or any Lender shall experience
increased costs or reduced receipts per, the circumstances described above, the
Borrower and the Administrative Agent shall agree in good faith to find a
comparable rate for the Loans based upon the most recently available LIBOR Rate
(including, without limitation, as "ABR Loans" as provided in the Intelsat
Credit Agreement).

           (c) It is understood that to the extent duplicative of Section 5.4,
this Section 2.10 shall not apply to Taxes and shall in no event apply to
Excluded Taxes.

           2.11. COMPENSATION. If (a) any payment of principal of any Loan is
made by the Borrower to or for the account of a Lender other than on the last
day of the Interest Period for such Loan as a result of a payment or conversion
pursuant to Section 2.5, 2.6, 2.10, 5.1 or 5.2, as a result of acceleration of
the maturity of the Loans pursuant to Section 12 or for any other reason, (b)
any LIBOR Loan is not continued as a LIBOR Loan or (c) any prepayment of
principal of any LIBOR Loan is not made as a result of a withdrawn notice of
prepayment pursuant to Section 5.1 or 5.2, the Borrower shall, after receipt of
a written request by such Lender (which request shall set forth in reasonable
detail the basis for requesting such amount), pay to the Administrative Agent
for the account of such Lender any amounts required to compensate such Lender
for any additional losses, costs or expenses that such Lender may reasonably
incur as a result of such payment, failure to continue or failure to prepay,
including any loss, cost or expense (excluding loss of anticipated profits)
actually incurred by reason of the liquidation or reemployment of deposits or
other funds acquired by any Lender to fund or maintain such LIBOR Loan.

           2.12. CHANGE OF LENDING OFFICE. Each Lender agrees that, upon the
occurrence of any event giving rise to the operation of Section 2.10(a)(ii),
2.10(a)(iii), 2.10(b) or 5.4 with respect to such Lender, it will, if requested
by the Borrower use reasonable efforts (subject to overall policy considerations
of such Lender) to designate another lending office for any Loans affected by
such event, PROVIDED that such designation is made on such terms that such
Lender and its lending office suffer no economic, legal or regulatory
disadvantage, with the object of avoiding the consequence of the event giving
rise to the operation of any such Section. Nothing in this Section 2.12 shall
affect or postpone any of the obligations of the Borrower or the right of any
Lender provided in Section 2.10 or 5.4.

           2.13. NOTICE OF CERTAIN COSTS. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, to the extent any notice required by Section 2.10,
2.11 or 5.4 is given by any Lender more than 90 days after such Lender has
knowledge (or should have had knowledge) of the occurrence of the event giving
rise to the additional cost, reduction in amounts, loss, tax or other additional
amounts described in such Sections, such Lender shall not be entitled to
compensation



                                       -53-
<PAGE>

under Section 2.10, 2.11 or 5.4, as the case may be, for any such amounts
incurred or accruing prior to the 91st day prior to the giving of such notice to
the Borrower.

           SECTION 3. [RESERVED]

           SECTION 4. FEES; COMMITMENTS.

           4.1. FEES. On the Initial Maturity Date, pursuant to Section 2(d) of
the Fee Letter, the Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent (for the
benefit of the Initial Lenders) a fee in the amount of 2.25% of the aggregate
principal amount of Loans outstanding on such date; PROVIDED that Exchange Notes
in such principal amount are issued on such date. Such fee shall be fully earned
when paid and shall not be refundable for any reason whatsoever, except as
provided in Section 2(d) of the Fee Letter. Without duplication, the Borrower
shall pay to the Lenders such fees as shall have been separately agreed upon in
writing in the amounts and at the times so specified; PROVIDED, that the parties
hereto acknowledge that except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, no other
fees are payable under the Fee Letter (or otherwise) in connection with the
Loans made pursuant to this Agreement. Any Loans made hereunder shall be deemed
"Interim Loans" for purposes of the engagement letter dated August 28, 2005
among the Borrower and the investment banks party thereto from time to time.
Except as otherwise provided for herein, no other fees shall be payable by the
Borrower in connection with any Loans made under this Agreement (under the Fee
Letter or otherwise).

           4.2. MANDATORY TERMINATION OF COMMITMENTS.

           The Commitments shall terminate at 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on
the Closing Date.

           SECTION 5. PAYMENTS.

           5.1. VOLUNTARY PREPAYMENTS. The Borrower shall have the right to
prepay Loans without premium or penalty, in whole or in part from time to time,
prior to the Initial Maturity Date at a repayment price of 100% of the principal
amount so repaid plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the date of
prepayment. Any prepayment of LIBOR Loans pursuant to this Section 5.1 on any
day other than the last day of an Interest Period applicable thereto shall be
subject to compliance by the Borrower with the applicable provisions of Section
2.11.

           5.2. MANDATORY PREPAYMENTS.

           (a) CHANGE OF CONTROL PREPAYMENT OFFER. Unless otherwise prepaid in
accordance with Section 5.1, upon the occurrence of a Change of Control, each
Lender shall have the right to require the Borrower to prepay all or any part of
such Lender's Loans at a price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount
thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of such
repayment.

           Within 90 days following any Change of Control, the Borrower shall
provide a written notice to the Administrative Agent containing the following
information (such notice, a "CHANGE OF CONTROL OFFER"):



                                       -54-
<PAGE>

           (i) that a Change of Control has occurred and that such Lender has
     the right to require the Borrower to repay such Lender's Loans at a price
     in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and
     unpaid interest to the date of purchase;

           (ii) the circumstances and relevant facts and financial information
     regarding such Change of Control;

           (iii) the repayment date (which shall be no earlier than 30 days nor
     later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed); and

           (iv) a statement that any Lender wishing to have its Loans repaid
     pursuant to such Change of Control must comply with Section 5.2(c).

           A Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of
Control, and conditioned upon such Change of Control, if a definitive agreement
is in place for the Change of Control at the time of making the Change of
Control Offer.

           Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section, the
Borrower shall not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change
of Control if a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at
the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in Section
5.2(a) applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Borrower and repays
all Loans validly offered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer.

           (b) ASSET SALE PREPAYMENT OFFER. Promptly, and in any event within
ten (10) Business Days after the Borrower becomes obligated to make a prepayment
offer pursuant to Section 10.4, the Borrower shall make an offer to prepay the
Loans at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and
unpaid interest, if any, to the prepayment date (an "EXCESS PROCEEDS OFFER"). In
order to make an Excess Proceeds Offer, the Borrower shall provide a written
notice thereof to the Administrative Agent. Such notice shall contain the
following:

           (i) that an Excess Proceeds Offer is being made pursuant to the
     Agreement;

           (ii) the prepayment price and prepayment date, which shall be,
     subject to any contrary requirements of applicable law, a Business Day no
     earlier than 30 days nor later than 60 days after the date on which such
     notice is delivered to the Administrative Agent;

           (iii) such information regarding the Borrower and its Subsidiaries as
     the Borrower in good faith believes will enable Lenders to make an informed
     decision with respect to such Excess Proceeds Offer; and

           (iv) a statement that any Lender wishing to have its Loans repaid
     pursuant to such Excess Proceeds Offer must comply with Section 5.2(c).

           (c) PROCEDURES FOR LENDERS TO ACCEPT MANDATORY PREPAYMENT OFFERS;
WITHDRAWAL OF ACCEPTANCE OF A MANDATORY PREPAYMENT OFFER. In order to accept any
Mandatory Pre-



                                       -55-
<PAGE>

payment Offer, a Lender shall notify the Administrative Agent in writing at its
address for notices contained in this Agreement prior to the Mandatory Offer
Election Time of such Lender's election to require the Borrower to prepay all or
a portion of such Lender's Loans pursuant to such Mandatory Prepayment Offer
(which, in the case of any election to require less than all of such Lender's
Loans to be prepaid in such Mandatory Prepayment Offer, shall be in a minimum
principal amount of $2,000 or an integral multiple thereof) and shall specify
the amount of such Lender's Loans which such Lender requests be prepaid in such
Mandatory Prepayment Offer. In order to validly withdraw any election with
respect to any Put Loans in any Mandatory Prepayment Offer, the Lender holding
such Put Loans shall notify the Administrative Agent in writing at its address
for notices contained in this Agreement prior to the Mandatory Offer Election
Time of such Lender's election to withdraw such Put Loans from such Mandatory
Prepayment Offer, which notification shall include a copy of such Lender's
previous notification electing to have its Put Loans prepaid in such Mandatory
Prepayment Offer and shall state that such election is withdrawn. The
Administrative Agent shall from time to time, upon request by the Borrower,
advise the Borrower of the amount of Put Loans with respect to any Mandatory
Prepayment Offer.

           5.3. METHOD AND PLACE OF PAYMENT.

           (a) Except as otherwise specifically provided herein, all payments
under this Agreement shall be made by the Borrower, without set-off,
counterclaim or deduction of any kind, to the Administrative Agent for the
ratable account of the Lenders entitled thereto not later than 12:00 Noon (New
York City time) on the date when due and shall be made in immediately available
funds at the Administrative Agent's Office or at such other office as the
Administrative Agent shall specify for such purpose by notice to the Borrower,
it being understood that written or facsimile notice by the Borrower to the
Administrative Agent to make a payment from the funds in the Borrower's account
at the Administrative Agent's Office shall constitute the making of such payment
to the extent of such funds held in such account. All payments under each Credit
Document (whether of principal, interest or otherwise) shall be made in Dollars.
The Administrative Agent will thereafter cause to be distributed on the same day
(if payment was actually received by the Administrative Agent prior to 2:00 p.m.
(New York City time) on such day) like funds relating to the payment of
principal or interest or Fees ratably to the Lenders entitled thereto.

           (b) Any payments under this Agreement that are made later than 2:00
p.m. (New York City time) shall be deemed to have been made on the next
succeeding Business Day. Whenever any payment to be made hereunder shall be
stated to be due on a day that is not a Business Day, the due date thereof shall
be extended to the next succeeding Business Day and, with respect to payments of
principal, interest shall be payable during such extension at the applicable
rate in effect immediately prior to such extension.

           5.4. NET PAYMENTS.

           (a) Any and all payments made by or on behalf of the Borrower or any
Guarantor under this Agreement or any other Credit Document shall be made free
and clear of, and without deduction or withholding for or on account of, any
Indemnified Taxes; PROVIDED that if Borrower or any Guarantor shall be required
by law to deduct or withhold any Indemnified



                                       -56-
<PAGE>

Taxes from such payments, then (i) the sum payable shall be increased as
necessary so that after making all required deductions and withholdings
(including deductions or withholdings of Indemnified Taxes applicable to
additional sums payable under this Section 5.4) the Administrative Agent or any
Lender, as the case may be, receives an amount equal to the sum it would have
received had no such deductions or withholdings been made, (ii) the Borrower or
any Guarantor shall make such deductions or withholdings and (iii) the Borrower
or any Guarantor shall pay the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant
Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law. Whenever any
Indemnified Taxes are payable by the Borrower, as promptly as possible
thereafter, the Borrower shall send to the Administrative Agent for its own
account or for the account of such Lender, as the case may be, a certified copy
of an original official receipt (or other evidence acceptable to such Lender,
acting reasonably) received by the Borrower showing payment thereof.

           (b) Borrower shall pay and shall indemnify and hold harmless the
Administrative Agent and each Lender (whether or not such Other Taxes were
correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority)
with regard to any Other Taxes.

           (c) Borrower shall indemnify and hold harmless the Administrative
Agent and each Lender within 15 Business Days after written demand therefor, for
the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes imposed on the Administrative Agent or
such Lender as the case may be, on or with respect to any payment by or on
account of any obligation of the Borrower or any Guarantor hereunder or under
any other Credit Document (including Indemnified Taxes imposed or asserted on or
attributable to amounts payable under this Section 5.4) and any reasonable
expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such
Indemnified Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant
Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or
liability delivered to the Borrower by a Lender or by the Administrative Agent
on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender shall be conclusive absent manifest
error.

           (d) A Foreign Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or
reduction in a withholding tax imposed under the laws of Bermuda with respect to
payments under this Agreement or any other Credit Document shall deliver to the
Borrower and the Administrative Agent, at the time or times prescribed by
applicable law and as reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative
Agent such properly completed and executed documentation as will permit such
payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate, PROVIDED that such
Lender is legally entitled to complete, execute and deliver such documentation.
To the extent it is legally entitled to do so, each Lender agrees to use
reasonable efforts (consistent with legal and regulatory restrictions and
subject to overall policy considerations of such Lender) to file or deliver to
the Borrower and the Administrative Agent any certificate or document, as
reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, that may be
necessary to establish any available exemption from, or reduction in the amount
of, any withholding taxes imposed by a jurisdiction other than Bermuda;
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that a Lender shall not be required to file or deliver any
such certificate or document if in such Lender's reasonable judgment such
completion, execution or delivery would be disadvantageous to such Lender or
would subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost.



                                       -57-
<PAGE>

           (e) If the Borrower determines in good faith that a reasonable basis
exists for contesting any taxes for which indemnification has been demanded
hereunder, the relevant Lender or the Administrative Agent, as applicable, shall
cooperate with the Borrower in challenging such taxes at the Borrower's expense
if so requested by the Borrower. If any Lender or the Administrative Agent, as
applicable, receives a refund of a tax for which a payment has been made by the
Borrower pursuant to this Agreement (or reduction of, or credit against its tax
liabilities in lieu of a refund), which refund, reduction or credit in the good
faith judgment of such Lender or Administrative Agent, as the case may be, is
attributable to such payment made by the Borrower, then the Lender or the
Administrative Agent, as the case may be, shall reimburse the Borrower for such
amount (together with any interest received thereon) as the Lender or
Administrative Agent, as the case may be, determines to be the proportion of the
refund, reduction or credit as will leave it, after such reimbursement, in no
better or worse position (taking into account expenses or any taxes imposed on
the refund) than it would have been in if the payment had not been required. A
Lender or Administrative Agent shall claim any refund, reduction or credit that
it determines is available to it, unless it concludes in its reasonable
discretion that it would be adversely affected by making such a claim. Neither
the Lender nor the Administrative Agent shall be obliged to disclose any
information regarding its tax affairs or computations to the Borrower in
connection with this paragraph (e) or any other provision of this Section 5.4.

           (f) The agreements in this Section 5.4 shall survive the termination
of this Agreement and the payment of the Loans and all other amounts payable
hereunder.

           5.5. COMPUTATIONS OF INTEREST AND FEES. Interest on LIBOR Loans shall
be calculated on the basis of a 360-day year for the actual days elapsed.

           5.6. LIMIT ON RATE OF INTEREST.

           (a) NO PAYMENT SHALL EXCEED LAWFUL RATE. Notwithstanding any other
term of this Agreement, the Borrower shall not be obliged to pay any interest or
other amounts under or in connection with this Agreement in excess of the amount
or rate permitted under or consistent with any applicable law, rule or
regulation.

           (b) PAYMENT AT HIGHEST LAWFUL RATE. If the Borrower is not obliged to
make a payment which it would otherwise be required to make, as a result of
Section 5.6(a), the Borrower shall make such payment to the maximum extent
permitted by or consistent with applicable laws, rules and regulations.

           (c) ADJUSTMENT IF ANY PAYMENT EXCEEDS LAWFUL RATE. If any provision
of this Agreement or any of the other Credit Documents would obligate the
Borrower to make any payment of interest or other amount payable to any Lender
in an amount or calculated at a rate which would be prohibited by any applicable
law, rule or regulation, then notwithstanding such provision, such amount or
rate shall be deemed to have been adjusted with retroactive effect to the
maximum amount or rate of interest, as the case may be, as would not be so
prohibited by law, such adjustment to be effected, to the extent necessary, by
reducing the amount or rate of interest required to be paid by the Borrower to
the affected Lender under Section 2.8.

           Notwithstanding the foregoing, and after giving effect to all
adjustments contemplated thereby, if any Lender shall have received from the
Borrower an amount in excess of the maximum permitted by any applicable law,
rule or regulation, then the Borrower shall be entitled, by notice in writing to
the Administrative Agent to obtain reimbursement from that Lender in an amount
equal to such excess, and pending such reimbursement, such amount shall be
deemed to be an amount payable by that Lender to the Borrower.

the Borrower make the following representations and warranties to, and
agreements with, the Lenders on the Closing Date:

           8.1. CORPORATE STATUS. Each of the Borrower and the Material
Subsidiaries (a) is a duly organized and validly existing corporation or other
entity in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization
and has the corporate or other organizational power and authority to own its
property and assets and to transact the business in which it is engaged and (b)
has duly qualified and is authorized to do business and is in good standing in
all jurisdictions where it is required to be so qualified, except where the

Material Adverse Effect.

           8.2. CORPORATE POWER AND AUTHORITY. The Borrower has the corporate or
other organizational power and authority to execute, deliver and carry out the
terms and provisions of the Credit Documents to which it is a party and has

                                       -60-
<PAGE>

which it is a party. The Borrower has duly executed and delivered each Credit
Document to which it is a party and each such Credit Document which is currently
in effect constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of the Borrower
enforceable in accordance with its terms, except as the enforceability thereof
may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency or similar laws affecting creditors'
rights generally and subject to general principles of equity.

           8.3. NO VIOLATION. Neither the execution, delivery or performance by
the Borrower of the Credit Documents to which it is a party and which is
currently in effect nor compliance with the terms and provisions thereof nor the
consummation of the Acquisition and the other transactions contemplated hereby
or thereby will (a) contravene any applicable provision of any material law,
statute, rule, regulation, order, writ, injunction or decree of any court or
governmental instrumentality, (b) result in any breach of any of the terms,
covenants, conditions or provisions of, or constitute a default under, or result
in the creation or imposition of (or the obligation to create or impose) any
Lien upon any of the property or assets of the Borrower or any of the Restricted
Subsidiaries (other than Liens created under the Credit Documents) pursuant to,
the terms of any material indenture (including the Senior Note Indentures), loan
agreement, lease agreement, mortgage, deed of trust, agreement or other material
instrument to which the Borrower or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries is a
party or by which it or any of its property or assets is bound or (c) violate
any provision of the certificate of incorporation, by-laws or other
constitutional documents of the Borrower or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries.

           8.4. LITIGATION. There are no actions, suits or proceedings
(including Environmental Claims) pending or, to the knowledge of the Borrower,
threatened with respect to the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries that could
reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect or a Material
Adverse Change.

           8.5. MARGIN REGULATIONS. Neither the making of any Loan hereunder nor
the use of the proceeds thereof will violate the provisions of Regulation T, U
or X of the Board.

           8.6. GOVERNMENTAL APPROVALS. The execution, delivery and performance
of the Transaction Agreement or any Credit Document currently in effect does not
require any consent or approval of, registration or filing with, or any other
action by, any Governmental Authority, except for (i) such as have been obtained
or made and are in full force and effect, (ii) such FCC consents, approvals,
registrations, and filings as may be required in the ordinary course of business
of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries in connection with the use of proceeds of
the Loans hereunder, (iii) such licenses, approvals, authorizations and consents
as may be required by the U.S. Department of State pursuant to the International
Traffic in Arms Regulations, the U.S. Department of Commerce pursuant to the
Export Administration Regulations and the U.S. Department of Treasury pursuant
to Foreign Asset Control Regulations in connection with the exercise of rights
hereunder and under the Security Documents following an Event of Default and
(iv) such licenses, approvals, authorizations or consents the failure to obtain
or make could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

           8.7. INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT. The Borrower is not an "investment
company" within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.



                                       -61-

           8.8. TRUE AND COMPLETE DISCLOSURE.

           (a) None of the factual information and data (taken as a whole)
heretofore or contemporaneously furnished by the Borrower, any of the
Subsidiaries or any of their respective authorized representatives in writing to
the Administrative Agent and/or any Lender in the Offering Memorandum and all
information contained in the Credit Documents currently in effect) for purposes
of or in connection with this Agreement or any transaction contemplated herein
contained any untrue statement or omitted to state any material fact necessary
to make such information and data (taken as a whole) not misleading at such time
in light of the circumstances under which such information or data was furnished
(subject, in the case of quarterly or interim financial statements, to normal
year-end audit adjustments), it being understood and agreed that for purposes of
this Section 8.8(a), such factual information and data shall not include
projections and pro forma financial information.

           (b) The projections and pro forma financial information contained in
the information and data referred to in paragraph (a) above were based on good
faith estimates and assumptions believed by such Persons to be reasonable at the
time made, it being recognized by the Lenders that such projections as to future
events are not to be viewed as facts and that actual results during the period
or periods covered by any such projections may differ from the projected
results.

           8.9. FINANCIAL CONDITION; FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. The unaudited
historical consolidated financial information of the Borrower as set forth in
the Offering Memorandum presents fairly in all material respects the combined
financial position of the Borrower at the respective dates of said information,
statements and results of operations for the respective periods covered thereby
(subject, in the case of quarterly or interim financial statements, to normal
year-end audit adjustments). There has been no Material Adverse Change since
December 31, 2005 (giving effect to the Transactions as if they had occurred
prior thereto).

           8.10. TAX RETURNS AND PAYMENTS.

           (a) The Borrower and each of the Subsidiaries has filed all federal
income tax returns and all other material tax returns, domestic and foreign,
required to be filed by it and has paid all material Taxes payable by it that
have become due, other than those (i) not yet delinquent or (ii) contested in
good faith as to which adequate reserves have been provided in accordance with
GAAP and which could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse
Effect. The Borrower and each of the Subsidiaries have paid, or have provided
adequate reserves (in the good faith judgment of the management of the Borrower)
in accordance with GAAP for the payment of, all material federal, state,
provincial and foreign income taxes applicable for all prior fiscal years and
for the current fiscal year.

           (b) None of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries has ever been a
party to any understanding or arrangement constituting a "tax shelter" within
the meaning of Section 6662(d)(2)(C)(iii) of the Code or within the meaning of
Section 6111(c) or Section 6111(d) of the Code as in effect immediately prior to
the enactment of the American Jobs Creation of 2004, or has ever "participated"
in a "reportable transaction" within the meaning of Treasury Regula-



                                       -62-
<PAGE>

tion Section 1.6011-4, except as could not reasonably be likely to, individually
or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect.

           8.11. COMPLIANCE WITH ERISA.

           (a) Each Plan is in compliance with ERISA, the Code and any
applicable Requirement of Law; no Reportable Event has occurred (or is
reasonably likely to occur) with respect to any Plan; no Plan is insolvent or in
reorganization (or is reasonably likely to be insolvent or in reorganization),
and no written notice of any such insolvency or reorganization has been given to
the Borrower, any Subsidiary or any ERISA Affiliate; no Plan (other than a
multiemployer plan) has an accumulated or waived funding deficiency (or is
reasonably likely to have such a deficiency); none of the Borrower, any
Subsidiary or any ERISA Affiliate has incurred (or is reasonably likely expected
to incur) any liability to or on account of a Plan pursuant to Section 409,
502(i), 502(l), 515, 4062, 4063, 4064, 4069, 4201 or 4204 of ERISA or Section
4971 or 4975 of the Code or has been notified in writing that it will incur any
liability under any of the foregoing Sections with respect to any Plan; no
proceedings have been instituted (or are reasonably likely to be instituted) to
terminate or to reorganize any Plan or to appoint a trustee to administer any
Plan, and no written notice of any such proceedings has been given to the
Borrower, any Subsidiary or any ERISA Affiliate; and no lien imposed under the
Code or ERISA on the assets of the Borrower or any Subsidiary or any ERISA
Affiliate exists (or is reasonably likely to exist) nor has the Borrower, any
Subsidiary or any ERISA Affiliate been notified in writing that such a lien will
be imposed on the assets of the Borrower, any Subsidiary or any ERISA Affiliate
on account of any Plan, except to the extent that a breach of any of the
representations, warranties or agreements in this Section 8.11 would not result,
individually or in the aggregate, in an amount of liability that would be
reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect or relates to any matter
disclosed in the financial statements of the Borrower contained in the Offering
Memorandum. No Plan (other than a multiemployer plan) has an Unfunded Current
Liability that would, individually or when taken together with any other
liabilities referenced in this Section 8.11, be reasonably likely to have a
Material Adverse Effect. With respect to Plans that are multiemployer plans (as
defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA), the representations and warranties in this
Section 8.11(a), other than any made with respect to (i) liability under Section
4201 or 4204 of ERISA or (ii) liability for termination or reorganization of
such Plans under ERISA, are made to the best knowledge of the Borrower.

           (b) All Foreign Plans are in compliance with, and have been
established, administered and operated in accordance with, the terms of such
Foreign Plans and applicable law, except for any failure to so comply,
establish, administer or operate the Foreign Plans as would not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. All contributions or other payments
which are due with respect to each Foreign Plan have been made in full and there
are no funding deficiencies thereunder, except to the extent any such events
would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect.

           8.12. SUBSIDIARIES. All outstanding capital stock of the Borrower is
owned by Holdings.

           8.13. PATENTS, ETC. The Borrower and each of the Restricted
Subsidiaries have obtained all patents, trademarks, servicemarks, trade names,
copyrights, licenses and other rights,



                                       -63-
<PAGE>

free from burdensome restrictions, that are necessary for the operation of their
respective businesses as currently conducted and as proposed to be conducted,
except where the failure to obtain any such rights could not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

           8.14. ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS.

Adverse Effect: (i) the Borrower and each of the Subsidiaries and all Real
Estate are in compliance with all Environmental Laws; (ii) none of the Borrower
or any of the Subsidiaries is subject to any Environmental Claim or any other
liability under any Environmental Law; (iii) the Borrower and its Subsidiaries
are not conducting any investigation, removal, remedial or other corrective

stored, transported, released or disposed or arranged for disposal or transport
for disposal of Hazardous Materials at, on, under or from any currently or
formerly owned or leased Real Estate or facility in a manner that could
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

           8.15. PROPERTIES. The Borrower and each of the Subsidiaries have good
and marketable title to or leasehold interest in all properties that are
necessary for the operation of their respective businesses as currently
conducted and as proposed to be conducted, free and clear of all Liens (other
than any Liens permitted by this Agreement) and except where the failure to have
such good title could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect.

           8.16. SOLVENCY. On the Closing Date (after giving effect to the
Transactions), immediately following the making of each Loan and after giving
effect to the application of the proceeds of such Loans, the Borrower, on a
consolidated basis with its Subsidiaries, will be Solvent.

           8.17. [INTENTIONALLY OMITTED].

           8.18. [RESERVED].

           8.19. [RESERVED].

           SECTION 9. AFFIRMATIVE COVENANTS.

thereafter, until the Loans, together with interest, Fees and all other
Obligations incurred hereunder, are paid in full or exchanged for Exchange Notes
in accordance with the terms hereof:



                                       -64-
<PAGE>

           9.1. REPORTS AND OTHER INFORMATION.

           (a) Notwithstanding that the Borrower may not be subject to the
reporting requirements of Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act or otherwise
report on an annual and quarterly basis on forms provided for such annual and
quarterly reporting pursuant to rules and regulations promulgated by the
Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), the Borrower shall file with the
SEC (unless the SEC will not accept such a filing), and provide the
Administrative Agent and Lenders with copies thereof, without cost to each
Lender, within 15 days after it files or, in the case of a Form 6-K, furnishes
(or attempts to file or furnish) them with the SEC,

           (i) within 90 days after the end of each fiscal year (or such longer
     period as may be permitted by the SEC if the Borrower were then subject to
     such SEC reporting requirements as a required filer, voluntary filer or
     otherwise), an annual report (which, if permitted under applicable rules of
     the SEC, may be the annual report of Holdings or another Parent of the
     Borrower) on Form 10-K or 20-F (or any successor or comparable forms)
     containing the information required to be contained therein (or required in
     such successor or comparable form) and

           (ii) within 45 days after the end of each of the first three fiscal
     quarters of each fiscal year (or such longer period as may be permitted by
     the SEC if the Borrower were then subject to such SEC reporting
     requirements as a required filer, voluntary filer or otherwise), a
     quarterly report (which, if permitted under applicable rules of the SEC,
     may be the quarterly report of Holdings or another Parent of the Borrower)
     on Form 10-Q or 6-K (or any successor or comparable forms), including a
     Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
     Operations or substantially similar section (whether or not required by
     such form).

           (b) The Borrower shall make the information required by Section
9.1(a) available to prospective lenders upon request. In addition, the Borrower
shall, for so long as any Loans remain outstanding during any period when it is
not subject to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, or otherwise permitted
to furnish the SEC with certain information pursuant to Rule 12g3-2(b) of the
Exchange Act, furnish to the Lenders and prospective lenders, upon their
request, the information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4)
under the Securities Act.

           (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing Sections 9.1(a) and (b), the
Borrower will be deemed to have furnished the reports required by Sections
9.1(a) and (b) to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders if it or Holdings or
another Parent of the Borrower has filed (or, in the case of a Form 6-K,
furnished) such reports with the SEC via the EDGAR filing system and such
reports are publicly available. In addition, such requirements shall be deemed
satisfied prior to the commencement of the exchange offer relating to the
Intelsat Bermuda Notes contemplated by the applicable registration rights
agreement or the effectiveness of any shelf registration statement by the filing
with the SEC of the exchange offer registration statement and/or shelf
registration statement in accordance with the provisions of the applicable
registration rights agreement, and any amendments thereto, with such financial
information that satisfies Regulation S-X of the Securities Act and such
registration statement and/or amendments thereto are filed at times that
otherwise satisfy the time requirements set forth in Section 9.1(a) hereof.



                                       -65-
<PAGE>

           (d) In the event that any Parent of the Borrower is or becomes a
Guarantor or co-obligor of the Loans, the Borrower may satisfy its obligations
under this Section 9.1 with respect to financial information relating to the
Borrower by furnishing financial information relating to such Parent; PROVIDED
that, if required by Regulation S-X under the Securities Act, the same is
accompanied by consolidating information that explains in reasonable detail the
differences between the information relating to such Parent and any of its
Subsidiaries other than the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and
the information relating to the Borrower, any Subsidiary Guarantors, if any, and
the other Subsidiaries of the Borrower on a stand-alone basis, on the other
hand.

           (e) In the event that the Borrower changes its fiscal year end from
the fiscal year end used by the Borrower as of the Closing Date, the Borrower
shall promptly give notice of such change to the Administrative Agent.

           9.2. [Reserved].

           9.3. MAINTENANCE OF INSURANCE. The Borrower will, and will cause each
of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, obtain, maintain and keep in full force and
effect at all times (i) with respect to each Satellite procured by the Borrower
or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries for which the risk of loss passes to the
Borrower or such Restricted Subsidiary at or before launch, and for which launch
insurance or commitments with respect thereto are not in place as of the Closing
Date, launch insurance with respect to each such Satellite covering the launch
of such Satellite and a period of time thereafter, but only to the extent, if at
all, and on such terms (including coverage period, exclusions, limitations on
coverage, co-insurance, deductibles and coverage amount) as is determined by the
Borrower to be in the best interests of the Borrower, (ii) with respect to each
Satellite it currently owns or for which it has risk of loss (or, if the entire
Satellite is not owned, the portion it owns or for which it has risk of loss),
other than any Excluded Satellite, In-Orbit Insurance and (iii) at all times
subsequent to the coverage period of the launch insurance described in clause
(i) above, if any, or if launch insurance is not procured, at all times
subsequent to the initial completion of in-orbit testing, in each case with
respect to each Satellite it then owns or for which it has risk of loss (or
portion, as applicable), other than any Excluded Satellite, In-Orbit Insurance;
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that at any time with respect to a Satellite that is not an
Excluded Satellite, none of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries shall be
required to maintain In-Orbit Insurance in excess of 33% of the aggregate net
book value of all in-orbit Satellites (and portions it owns or for which it has
risk of loss) insured (it being understood that any Satellite (or portion, as
applicable) protected by In-Orbit Contingency Protection shall be deemed to be
insured for a percentage of its net book value as set forth in the definition of
"In-Orbit Contingency Protection"). In the event that the expiration and
non-renewal of In-Orbit Insurance for such a Satellite (or portion, as
applicable) resulting from a claim of loss under such policy causes a failure to
comply with the proviso in the immediately preceding sentence, the Borrower and
its Restricted Subsidiaries shall be deemed to be in compliance with such
proviso for the 120 days immediately following such expiration or non-renewal,
PROVIDED that the Borrower or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, as the case
may be, procures such In-Orbit Insurance or provides such In-Orbit Contingency
Protection as necessary to comply with such proviso within such 120-day period.
In the event of the unavailability of any In-Orbit Contingency Protection for
any reason, the Borrower or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, as the case may
be,



                                       -66-
<PAGE>

shall, subject to the first proviso above, within 120 days of such
unavailability, be required to have in effect In-Orbit Insurance complying with
clause (ii) or (iii) above, as applicable, with respect to all Satellites (or
portions, as applicable), other than Excluded Satellites that the unavailable
In-Orbit Contingency Protection was intended to protect and for so long as such
In-Orbit Contingency Protection is unavailable, PROVIDED that the Borrower and
its Restricted Subsidiaries shall be considered in compliance with this
insurance covenant for the 120 days immediately following such unavailability.

           9.4. PAYMENT OF TAXES The Borrower will pay and discharge, and the
Borrower will cause each of its Restricted Subsidiaries to pay and discharge,
all material taxes, assessments and governmental charges or levies imposed upon
it or upon its income or profits, or upon any properties belonging to it, prior
to the date on which material penalties attach thereto, and all lawful material
claims that, if unpaid, could reasonably be expected to become a material Lien
upon any properties of the Borrower or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries,
PROVIDED that none of the Borrower or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries shall
be required to pay any such tax, assessment, charge, levy or claim that is being
contested in good faith and by proper proceedings if it has maintained adequate
reserves (in the good faith judgment of the management of the Borrower) with
respect thereto in accordance with GAAP and the failure to pay could not
reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.

           9.5. CONSOLIDATED CORPORATE FRANCHISES. The Borrower will do, and the
Borrower will cause each Material Subsidiary to do, or cause to be done, all
things necessary to preserve and keep in full force and effect its existence,
corporate rights and authority, except to the extent that the failure to do so
could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect; PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, that the Borrower and its Subsidiaries may consummate any transaction
permitted under Section 10.4 or 10.10.

           9.6. COMPLIANCE WITH STATUTES, REGULATIONS, ETC. The Borrower will,
and will cause each Subsidiary to, comply with all applicable laws, rules,
regulations and orders applicable to it or its property (including all FCC
Licenses and all other governmental approvals or authorizations required to
launch and operate the Satellites and the TT&C Stations related thereto) and to
transmit signals to and receive transmissions from the Satellites, and to
maintain all such FCC Licenses and other governmental approvals or
authorizations in full force and effect, in each case except where the failure
to do so could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect (it
being understood that any failure as it may relate to any FCC License for a
Satellite that is yet to be launched shall not, in itself, be considered or
deemed to result in a Material Adverse Effect).

ERISA Affiliate knows or has reason to know of the occurrence of any of the
following events that, individually or in the aggregate (including in the

to the extent the liability therefor remains outstanding), would be reasonably
likely to have a Material Adverse Effect, the Borrower will deliver to each of
the Lenders a certificate of an Authorized Officer or any other senior officer
of the Borrower setting forth details as to such occurrence and the action, if
any, that the Borrower, such Subsidiary or such ERISA Affiliate is required or

under any substantially similar agreement) to cause its Restricted Subsidiaries
(other than Intelsat General, and other than any other Government Business
Subsidiary), not to allow or permit, directly or indirectly, Intelsat General,
or such other Government Business Subsidiary, to take, or fail to take, any
action that would violate the covenants and terms of this Agreement.

           (a) During the period beginning on the Closing Date and continuing to
the date that is 180 days after the Closing Date, the Borrower will not offer,
sell, contract to sell or otherwise incur, any Indebtedness (whether secured or
unsecured), the proceeds of which are used (directly or indirectly) to repay or
refinance the Loans under this Agreement.

           (b) Upon notice (a "TAKE-OUT NOTICE") by, and at the sole discretion
of, any three of the four Joint Lead Arrangers (the "REQUISITE LEAD ARRANGERS"),
at any time and from time to time after the 180th day after the Closing Date and
until the Initial Maturity Date shall have occurred, the Borrower will, subject
to the terms and conditions set forth below, issue and sell debt securities
(which debt securities shall be non-convertible notes (unless otherwise agreed
by the Borrower) and may be, at the option of the Requisite Lead Arrangers in
consultation with the Borrower, any combination of senior or senior
subordinated) on no more than two occasions in an aggregate amount not greater
than that required to refinance the Loans in full (the "TAKE-OUT SECURITIES"),
upon such terms and conditions as specified in the Take-Out Notice and agreed by
the Borrower if and to the extent such issuance of, and the performance of the
obligations of the Borrower under, such Take-Out Securities, is permitted under
the Borrower and its subsidiaries' debt and other agreements as in effect on the
Closing Date (after giving effect to the Transactions). In no event shall the
overall yield on the Take-Out Securities exceed 11 1/4% per annum.

           (c) The Requisite Lead Arrangers in their reasonable discretion after
consultation with the Borrower shall determine whether the Take-Out Securities
shall be issued through a public offering or a private placement. The Take-Out
Securities will contain terms and covenants to substantially the same effect as

           (d) The Borrower will, and will cause its subsidiaries to,
participate in and cooperate in connection with, the issuance of Take-Out
Securities, as reasonably requested by the Requisite Lead Arrangers, including
by (i) preparing an offering memorandum, (ii) using their commercially
reasonable efforts to procure ratings for the Take-Out Securities, including,
with-

out limitation, making appropriate officers of the Borrower available at
mutually agreeable times for meetings with rating agencies, (iii) preparing
materials related to, participating in, making management available at mutually
agreeable times for, and completing one or more "road shows", (iv) using all
reasonable efforts to procure a customary auditor comfort letter that does not
contain limits on liability and is otherwise issued on terms acceptable to the
Requisite Lead Arrangers in their sole discretion, and (v) entering into
customary agreements on mutually agreeable terms. In no event shall such
assistance interfere in any material way with the day-to-day operations of the
Borrower or its subsidiaries.

     then outstanding and Incurred pursuant to this clause (xii), does not
     exceed the greater of (x) $450.0 million and (y) 4% of Total Assets of the

Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock described in Sections 10.1(b)(i) through
(xxii) above or is entitled to be Incurred pursuant to Section 10.1(a), the
Borrower shall, in its sole discretion divide, classify or reclassify or later
divide, classify or reclassify such item of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or
Preferred Stock in any manner that complies with this Section 10.1 and such item
of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock shall be treated as
having been Incurred pursuant to one or more of such clauses or pursuant to
Section 10.1(a); PROVIDED that all Indebtedness under the Credit Agreements
outstanding on the Closing Date shall be deemed to have been Incurred pursuant

10.1(b)(i). Accrual of interest, the accretion of accreted value, amortization
or original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional
Indebtedness with the same terms, the payment of dividends on Preferred Stock in
the form of additional shares of Preferred Stock of the same class, the
accretion of liquidation preference and increases in the amount of Indebtedness
outstanding solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of
currencies shall not be deemed to be an Incurrence of Indebtedness for purposes
of this Section 10.1. Guarantees of, or obligations in respect of letters of
credit relating to, Indebtedness which is otherwise included in the
determination of a particular amount of Indebtedness shall not be included in
the determination of such amount of Indebtedness; PROVIDED that the Incurrence
of the Indebtedness represented by such guarantee or letter of credit, as the
case may be, was in compliance with this Section 10.1.

           For purposes of determining compliance with any U.S.
dollar-denominated restriction on the Incurrence of Indebtedness, the U.S.
Dollar Equivalent principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in a foreign
currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in
effect on the date such Indebtedness was Incurred, in the case of term debt, or
first committed or first Incurred (whichever yields the lower U.S. Dollar
Equivalent), in the case of revolving credit debt; PROVIDED that if such
Indebtedness is Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a
foreign currency, and such refinancing would cause the applicable U.S.
dollar-denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant
currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such U.S.
dollar-denominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long
as the principal amount of such refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the
principal amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced.

           10.2. LIMITATION ON RESTRICTED PAYMENTS.

           (a) The Borrower shall not, and shall not permit any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly:

     of the Borrower's or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries' Equity Interests,
     including any payment with respect to such Equity Interests made in
     connection with any merger, amalgamation or consolidation involving the
     Borrower (other than (A) dividends or distributions by the Borrower payable
     solely in Equity Interests (other than Disqualified Stock) of the Borrower;
     or (B) dividends or distributions by a Restricted Subsidiary so long as, in
     the case of any dividend or distribution payable on or in respect of any

           (13) any Restricted Investment not prohibited by Section 10.2 and any
     Permitted Investment; and

           (14) any encumbrances or restrictions of the type referred to in
     clauses (a), (b) and (c) above imposed by any amendments, modifications,
     restatements, renewals, increases, supplements, refundings, replacements or
     refinancings of the contracts, instruments or obligations referred to in
     clauses (1) through (13) above; PROVIDED that such amendments,
     modifications, restatements, renewals, increases, supplements, refundings,
     replacements or refinancings are, in the good faith judgment of the
     Borrower, no more restrictive as a whole with respect to such encumbrances
     and restrictions than those prior to such amendment, modification,
     restatement, renewal, increase, supplement, refunding, replacement or
     refinancing.

           For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, (i) the
priority of any Preferred Stock in receiving dividends or liquidating
distributions prior to dividends or liquidating distributions being paid on
ordinary shares shall not be deemed a restriction on the ability to make
distributions on Capital Stock and (ii) the subordination of loans or advances
made to the



                                       -83-
<PAGE>

Borrower or a Restricted Subsidiary of the Borrower to other Indebtedness
Incurred by the Borrower or any such Restricted Subsidiary shall not be deemed a
restriction on the ability to make loans or advances.

           10.4. ASSET SALES.

           (a) The Borrower shall not, and shall not permit any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries to, cause or make an Asset Sale, unless (x) the Borrower
or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, as the case may be, receives
consideration at the time of such Asset Sale at least equal to the Fair Market
Value (as determined in good faith by the Borrower) of the assets sold or
otherwise disposed of and (y) at least 75% of the consideration therefor
received by the Borrower or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, is
in the form of Cash Equivalents; PROVIDED that the amount of:

           (i) any liabilities (as shown on the Borrower's or such Restricted
     Subsidiary's most recent balance sheet or in the notes thereto) of the
     Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary of the Borrower (other than
     liabilities that are by their terms subordinated to the Loans) that are
     assumed by the transferee of any such assets,

           (ii) any notes or other obligations or other securities or assets
     received by the Borrower or such Restricted Subsidiary of the Borrower from
     such transferee that are converted by the Borrower or such Restricted
     Subsidiary of the Borrower into cash within 180 days of the receipt thereof
     (to the extent of the cash received), and

           (iii) any Designated Non-cash Consideration received by the Borrower
     or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries in such Asset Sale having an
     aggregate Fair Market Value, taken together with all other Designated
     Non-cash Consideration received pursuant to this clause (iii) that is at
     that time outstanding, not to exceed 6.25% of Total Assets of the Borrower
     at the time of the receipt of such Designated Non-cash Consideration (with
     the Fair Market Value of each item of Designated Non-cash Consideration
     being measured at the time received and without giving effect to subsequent
     changes in value)

shall be deemed to be Cash Equivalents for the purposes of this Section 10.4(a).

           (b) Within 485 days after the Borrower's or any Restricted Subsidiary
of the Borrower's receipt of the Net Proceeds of any Asset Sale (or Event of
Loss Proceeds), the Borrower or such Restricted Subsidiary of the Borrower may
apply the Net Proceeds from such Asset Sale together with any Event of Loss
Proceeds, at its option:

           (i) to permanently reduce Obligations under Secured Indebtedness or
     Pari Passu Indebtedness (PROVIDED that if the Borrower or any Guarantor
     shall so reduce Obligations under Pari Passu Indebtedness (other than Pari
     Passu Indebtedness that is Secured Indebtedness and other than Pari Passu
     Indebtedness that is Indebtedness represented by the Borrower's guarantee
     of Indebtedness of any Restricted Subsidiary of the Borrower), the Borrower
     shall equally and ratably reduce Obligations under this Agreement if the
     Loans are then prepayable or, if the Loans may not then be prepaid, by
     making an offer (in accordance with the procedures set forth below for an
     Excess Proceeds Offer) to all



                                       -84-
<PAGE>

     Holders to purchase at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal
     amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional interest,
     if any, the pro rata principal amount of Loans that would otherwise be
     prepaid) or Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a
     Guarantor, in each case other than Indebtedness owed to the Borrower or an
     Affiliate of the Borrower; PROVIDED that if an offer to purchase any
     Indebtedness of any of the Borrower or its Restricted Subsidiaries is made
     in accordance with the terms of such Indebtedness, the obligation to
     permanently reduce Indebtedness of the Borrower or a Restricted Subsidiary,
     as the case may be, will be deemed to be satisfied to the extent of the
     amount of the offer, whether or not accepted by the holders thereof, and no
     Net Proceeds in the amount of such offer will be deemed to exist following
     such offer,

           (ii) to an investment in any one or more businesses (PROVIDED that if
     such investment is in the form of the acquisition of Capital Stock of a
     Person, such acquisition results in such Person becoming a Restricted
     Subsidiary of the Borrower), or capital expenditures or assets, in each
     case used or useful in a Similar Business, and/or

           (iii) to make an investment in any one or more businesses (PROVIDED
     that if such investment is in the form of the acquisition of Capital Stock
     of a Person, such acquisition results in such Person becoming a Restricted
     Subsidiary of the Borrower), properties or assets that replace the
     properties and assets that are the subject of such Asset Sale or Event of
     Loss;

PROVIDED that in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii) above, a binding commitment
shall be treated as a permitted application of the Net Proceeds from the date of
such commitment and, in the event such binding commitment is later canceled or
terminated for any reason before such Net Proceeds are so applied, the Borrower
or such Restricted Subsidiary enters into another binding commitment within nine
months of such cancellation or termination of the prior binding commitment.
Pending the final application of any such Net Proceeds (or Event of Loss
Proceeds), the Borrower or such Restricted Subsidiary of the Borrower may
temporarily reduce Indebtedness under a revolving credit facility, if any, or
otherwise invest such Net Proceeds (or Event of Loss Proceeds) in Cash
Equivalents or Investment Grade Securities. Any Net Proceeds from any Asset Sale
(or Event of Loss Proceeds) that are not applied as provided and within the time
period set forth in the first sentence of this Section 10.4(b) (it being
understood that any portion of such Net Proceeds (or Event of Loss Proceeds)
used to make an offer to prepay the Loans, as described in clause (i) above,
shall be deemed to have been invested whether or not such offer is accepted)
shall be deemed to constitute "EXCESS PROCEEDS." When the aggregate amount of
Excess Proceeds exceeds $55.0 million, the Borrower shall make a Prepayment
Offer pursuant to Section 5.2 and in accordance with this Section 10.4. Upon
completion of any such Excess Proceeds Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds
shall be reset at zero.

           10.5. TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES.

           (a) The Borrower shall not, and shall not permit any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, make any payment to, or
sell, lease, transfer or otherwise dispose of any of its properties or assets
to, or purchase any property or assets from, or enter into or make or amend any
transaction or series of transactions, contract, agreement, understanding, loan,
advance or guarantee with, or for the benefit of, any Affiliate of the Borrower
(each of the forego-



                                       -85-
<PAGE>

ing, an "AFFILIATE Transaction") involving aggregate consideration in excess of
$15.0 million, unless:

           (i) such Affiliate Transaction is on terms that are not materially
     less favorable to the Borrower or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary than
     those that could have been obtained in a comparable transaction by the
     Borrower or such Restricted Subsidiary with an unrelated Person; and

           (ii) with respect to any Affiliate Transaction or series of related
     Affiliate Transactions involving aggregate consideration in excess of $35.0
     million, the Borrower delivers to the Trustee a resolution adopted in good
     faith by the majority of the Board of Directors of the Borrower or any
     Parent of the Borrower approving such Affiliate Transaction and set forth
     in an Officers' Certificate certifying that such Affiliate Transaction
     complies with clause (i) above.

           (b) The provisions of Section 10.5(a) shall not apply to the
     following:

           (i) (A) transactions between or among the Borrower and/or any of its
     Restricted Subsidiaries and (B) any merger or amalgamation of the Borrower
     and any direct parent company of Borrower; PROVIDED that such parent
     company shall have no material liabilities and no material assets other
     than cash, Cash Equivalents and the Capital Stock of the Borrower and such
     merger or amalgamation is otherwise in compliance with the terms of this
     Agreement and effected for a bona fide business purpose;

           (ii) (A) Restricted Payments permitted by Section 10.2 and (B)
     Investments under the definition of "Permitted Investments";

           (iii) the entering into of any agreement to pay, and the payment of,
     management, consulting, monitoring and advisory fees and expenses to the
     Sponsors in an aggregate amount in any fiscal year not to exceed the
     greater of (x) $12.5 million and (y) 1.25% of Adjusted EBITDA of the
     Borrower and its Restricted Subsidiaries for the immediately preceding
     fiscal year;

           (iv) the payment of reasonable and customary fees to, and indemnity
     provided on behalf of officers, directors, employees or consultants of the
     Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary of the Borrower or any Parent of the
     Borrower;

           (v) payments by the Borrower or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to
     the Sponsors made for any financial advisory, financing, underwriting or
     placement services or in respect of other investment banking activities,
     including, without limitation, in connection with acquisitions or
     divestitures, which payments are (x) approved by a majority of the Board of
     Directors of the Borrower in good faith or (y) made pursuant to any
     agreement described under the caption "Certain Relationships and Related
     Party Transactions" in the Offering Memorandum;

           (vi) transactions in which the Borrower or any of its Restricted
     Subsidiaries, as the case may be, delivers to the Trustee a letter from an
     Independent Financial Advisor



                                       -86-
<PAGE>

     stating that such transaction is fair to the Borrower or such Restricted
     Subsidiary from a financial point of view or meets the requirements of
     clause (i) of Section 10.5(a);

           (vii) payments or loans (or cancellation of loans) to employees or
     consultants that are approved by a majority of the Board of Directors of
     the Borrower in good faith;

           (viii) any agreement as in effect as of the Closing Date and any
     amendment thereto (so long as any such agreement together with all
     amendments thereto, taken as a whole, is not more disadvantageous to the
     Lenders in any material respect than the original agreement as in effect on
     the Closing Date) or any transaction contemplated thereby;

           (ix) the existence of, or the performance by the Borrower or any of
     its Restricted Subsidiaries of its obligations under the terms of,
     Acquisition Documents and any amendment thereto or similar agreements which
     it may enter into thereafter; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the existence of, or
     the performance by the Borrower or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of
     its obligations under, any future amendment to any such existing agreement
     or under any similar agreement entered into after the Closing Date shall
     only be permitted by this clause (ix) to the extent that the terms of any
     such existing agreement together with all amendments thereto, taken as a
     whole, or new agreement are not otherwise more disadvantageous to the
     Lenders in any material respect than the original agreement as in effect on
     the Closing Date;

           (x) transactions to effect the Transactions and the payment of all
     fees and expenses related to the Transactions, as described in the Offering
     Memorandum or contemplated by the Acquisition Documents;

           (xi) (A) transactions with customers, clients, suppliers or
     purchasers or sellers of goods or services, in each case in the ordinary
     course of business and otherwise in compliance with the terms of this
     Agreement, which are fair to the Borrower and its Restricted Subsidiaries,
     in the reasonable judgment of the Borrower, or are on terms at least as
     favorable as might reasonably have been obtained at such time from an
     unaffiliated party and (B) transactions with Joint Ventures or Unrestricted
     Subsidiaries entered into in the ordinary course of business;

           (xii) any transaction effected as part of a Qualified Receivables
     Financing;

           (xiii) the issuance of Equity Interests (other than Disqualified
     Stock) of the Borrower to any Permitted Holder or to any director, officer,
     employee or consultant of the Borrower or any Parent of the Borrower;

           (xiv) the issuances of securities or other payments, awards or grants
     in cash, securities or otherwise pursuant to, or the funding of, employment

     benefit plans approved by the Board of Directors of the Borrower or any
     Parent of the Borrower or of a Restricted Subsidiary of the Borrower, as
     appropriate, in good faith;



                                       -87-
<PAGE>

           (xv) the entering into of any tax sharing agreement or arrangement
     and any payments permitted by clause (xii) of Section 10.2(b);

           (xvi) any contribution to the capital of the Borrower;

           (xvii) transactions permitted by, and complying with, the provisions
     of Section 10.10;

           (xviii) transactions between the Borrower or any of its Restricted
     Subsidiaries and any Person, a director of which is also a director of the
     Borrower or any Parent of the Borrower; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that such
     director abstains from voting as a director of the Borrower or such Parent,
     as the case maybe, on any matter involving such other Person;

           (xix) pledges of Equity Interests of Unrestricted Subsidiaries;

           (xx) any employment agreements entered into by the Borrower or any of
     its Restricted Subsidiaries in the ordinary course of business; and

           (xxi) any transaction pursuant to or in connection with the Specified
     Intercompany Agreements.

           10.6. CHANGE OF CONTROL.

           (a) Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control, each Lender shall
have the right to require the Borrower to repurchase all or any part of such
Lender's Loans at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount
thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of repurchase in
accordance with Section 5.2(b).

           (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section, the
Borrower shall not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change
of Control if a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at
the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in this
Section and Section 5.2(b) applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the
Borrower and purchases all Loans validly surrendered and not withdrawn under
such Change of Control Offer.

           10.7. FUTURE GUARANTORS. The Borrower shall not permit any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries (other than (i) any Receivables Subsidiary formed in
connection with a Qualified Receivables Financing and (ii) any License
Subsidiary in connection with any guarantee of any Credit Agreement) that is not
a Guarantor to, directly or indirectly, guarantee the payment of any
Indebtedness of the Borrower other than Permitted Debt unless such Subsidiary
executes and delivers to the Administrative Agent a Guarantee substantially in
the form of Exhibit A (together with such opinions or certificates reasonably
requested in connection therewith) pursuant to which such Subsidiary will
guarantee payment of the Loans. Each Guarantee shall be limited to an amount not
to exceed the maximum amount that can be guaranteed by that Restricted
Subsidiary without rendering the Guarantee, as it relates to such Restricted
Subsidiary, voidable under applicable law relating to fraudulent conveyance,
financial assistance or fraudulent transfer or similar laws affecting the rights
of creditors generally.



                                       -88-
<PAGE>

           10.8. LIENS. The Borrower shall not, and shall not permit any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, create, Incur or suffer to
exist any Lien (other than Permitted Liens) that secures any obligations under
Indebtedness of the Borrower against or on any asset or property now owned or
hereafter acquired by the Borrower, or any income or profits therefrom, unless:

           (1) in the case of Liens securing Indebtedness that is Subordinated
     Indebtedness, the Loans are secured by a Lien on such property or assets
     that is senior in priority to such Liens; and

           (2) in all other cases, the Loans are equally and ratably secured;

PROVIDED that any Lien which is granted to secure the Loans under this covenant
shall be automatically released and discharged at the same time as the release
of the Lien that gave rise to the obligation to secure the Loans under this
covenant.

           10.9. SUSPENSION OF COVENANTS.

           (a) During any period of time that: (i) the Loans have Investment
Grade Ratings from two Rating Agencies and (ii) no Default or Event of Default
has occurred and is continuing (the occurrence of the events described in the
foregoing clauses (i) and (ii) being collectively referred to as a "COVENANT
SUSPENSION EVENT"), the Borrower and the Restricted Subsidiaries shall not be
subject to the provisions of Sections 9.3, 10.1, 10.2, 10.3, 10.4, 10.5, 10.7,
10.10(a)(iv) (collectively, the "SUSPENDED COVENANTS").

           (b) Upon the occurrence of a Covenant Suspension Event, any
Guarantees of any Subsidiary Guarantors, if any, will also be suspended as of
such date (the "SUSPENSION DATE").

           (c) In the event that the Borrower and the Restricted Subsidiaries
are not subject to the Suspended Covenants for any period of time as a result of
the foregoing, and on any subsequent date (the "REVERSION DATE") one or both of
the Rating Agencies withdraws its Investment Grade Rating or downgrades the
rating assigned to the Loans below an Investment Grade Rating, then the Borrower
and the Restricted Subsidiaries will thereafter again be subject to the
Suspended Covenants with respect to future events and the Guarantees, if any, of
any Subsidiary Guarantors will be reinstated if such guarantees are then
required by the terms of this Agreement. The period of time between the
Suspension Date and the Reversion Date is referred to in this Agreement as the
"SUSPENSION PERIOD."

           (d) Notwithstanding that the Suspended Covenants may be reinstated,
no Default or Event of Default will be deemed to have occurred as a result of a
failure to comply with the Suspended Covenants during the Suspension Period (or
upon termination of the Suspension Period or after that time based solely on
events that occurred during the Suspension Period).

           (e) On the Reversion Date, all Indebtedness Incurred, or Disqualified
Stock or Preferred Stock issued, during the Suspension Period will be classified
as having been Incurred or issued pursuant to Section 10.1(a) or Section 10.1(b)
(to the extent such Indebtedness or Dis-



                                       -89-
<PAGE>

qualified Stock or Preferred Stock would be permitted to be Incurred or issued
thereunder as of the Reversion Date and after giving effect to Indebtedness
Incurred or issued prior to the Suspension Period and outstanding on the
Reversion Date). To the extent such Indebtedness or Disqualified Stock or
Preferred Stock would not be so permitted to be Incurred or issued pursuant to
Sections 10.1(a) or (b), such Indebtedness or Disqualified Stock or Preferred
Stock will be deemed to have been outstanding on the Closing Date, so that it is
classified as permitted under Section 10.1(b)(iii). Calculations made after the
Reversion Date of the amount available to be made as Restricted Payments under
Section 10.2 will be made as though under Section 10.2 had been in effect since
the Closing Date and throughout the Suspension Period. For the avoidance of
doubt, Restricted Payments made during the Suspension Period shall reduce the
amount available to be made as Restricted Payments under Section 10.2(a). No
Default or Event of Default shall be deemed to have occurred on the Reversion
Date as a result of any actions taken by the Borrower or its Restricted
Subsidiaries during the Suspension Period.

           (f) The Borrower shall deliver promptly to the Trustee an Officer's
Certificate notifying the Trustee of any Covenant Suspension Event or Reversion
Date, as the case may be, pursuant to this Section 10.9.

           10.10. WHEN BORROWER MAY MERGE OR TRANSFER ASSETS.

           (a) The Borrower shall not consolidate, amalgamate or merge with or
into or wind up into (whether or not the Borrower is the surviving corporation),
or sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of all or
substantially all of its properties or assets in one or more related
transactions to, any Person unless:

           (i) the Borrower is a surviving Person or the Person formed by or
     surviving any such consolidation, amalgamation or merger (if other than the
     Borrower) or to which such sale, assignment, transfer, lease, conveyance or
     other disposition shall have been made is a corporation, partnership or
     limited liability company organized or existing under the laws of the
     United States, any state thereof, the District of Columbia, or any
     territory thereof, under the laws of the jurisdiction of organization of
     the Borrower or any Subsidiary or Parent of the Borrower or under the laws
     of Bermuda or any country that is a member of the European Union (the
     Borrower or such Person, as the case may be, being herein called the
     "SUCCESSOR COMPANY");

           (ii) the Successor Company (if other than the Borrower) expressly
     assumes all the obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement and the
     Loans pursuant to documents or instruments in form reasonably satisfactory
     to the Administrative Agent;

           (iii) immediately after giving effect to such transaction, no Default
     or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing;

           (iv) immediately after giving pro forma effect to such transaction,
     as if such transaction had occurred at the beginning of the applicable
     four-quarter period (and treating any Indebtedness which becomes an
     obligation of the Successor Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries
     as a result of such transaction as having been Incurred by the Successor
     Company or such Restricted Subsidiary at the time of such transaction),
     either



                                       -90-
<PAGE>

                (1) the Successor Company would be permitted to Incur at least
           $1.00 of additional Indebtedness pursuant to the Debt to Adjusted
           EBITDA Ratio test set forth in Section 10.1(a); or

                (2) the Debt to Adjusted EBITDA Ratio for the Successor Company
           and its Restricted Subsidiaries would be equal to or less than such
           ratio for the Borrower and its Restricted Subsidiaries immediately
           prior to such transaction; and

           (v) any Guarantor, unless it is the other party to the transactions
     described above, shall have confirmed in writing that its Guarantee shall
     apply to such Person's obligations under this Agreement and the Loans.

           Notwithstanding the foregoing clauses (iii) and (iv) of this Section
10.10(a), (A) the Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary may consolidate or
amalgamate with, merge into, sell, assign or transfer, lease, convey or
otherwise dispose of all or part of its properties and assets to the Borrower or
to another Restricted Subsidiary and (B) the Borrower may merge, amalgamate or
consolidate with an Affiliate incorporated solely for the purpose of
reincorporating the Borrower in a (or another) state of the United States, the
District of Columbia, any territory of the United States, Bermuda or any country
that is a member of the European Union so long as the amount of Indebtedness of
the Borrower and its Restricted Subsidiaries is not increased thereby (any
transaction described in this sentence a "SPECIFIED MERGER/TRANSFER
TRANSACTION").

           (b) Subject to the provisions of any Guarantee, any Subsidiary
Guarantor shall not, and the Borrower shall not permit any Subsidiary Guarantor
to, consolidate, amalgamate or merge with or into or wind up into (whether or
not such Subsidiary Guarantor is the surviving Person), or sell, assign,
transfer, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its
properties or assets in one or more related transactions to, any Person unless:

           (i) such Subsidiary Guarantor is a surviving Person or the Person
     formed by or surviving any such consolidation, amalgamation or merger (if
     other than such Subsidiary Guarantor) or to which such sale, assignment,
     transfer, lease, conveyance or other disposition is made is a corporation,
     partnership or limited liability company organized or existing under the
     laws of the United States, any state thereof, the District of Columbia, or
     any territory thereof, under the laws of the jurisdiction of organization
     of the Borrower or any Subsidiary or Parent of the Issuer or under the laws
     of Bermuda or any country that is a member of the European Union (such
     Subsidiary Guarantor or such Person, as the case may be, being herein
     called the "SUCCESSOR GUARANTOR");

           (ii) the Successor Guarantor (if other than such Subsidiary
     Guarantor) expressly assumes all the obligations of such Subsidiary
     Guarantor under this Agreement and such Subsidiary Guarantor's Guarantee
     pursuant to documents or instruments in form reasonably satisfactory to the
     Administrative Agent; and

           (iii) immediately after giving effect to such transaction (and
     treating any Indebtedness which becomes an obligation of the Successor

     tor or such Subsidiary at the time of such transaction) no Default or Event
     of Default shall have occurred and be continuing.

           Subject to the limitations described in this Agreement, the Successor
Guarantor shall succeed to, and be substituted for, such Subsidiary Guarantor
under this Agreement and such Subsidiary Guarantor's Guarantee, and such
Subsidiary Guarantor will automatically be released and discharged from its
obligations under this Agreement and such Subsidiary Guarantor's guarantee.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, (1) a Subsidiary Guarantor may merge, amalgamate
or consolidate with an Affiliate incorporated solely for the purpose of
reincorporating such Subsidiary Guarantor in a (or another) state of the United
States, the District of Columbia, any territory of the United States, Bermuda or
any country that is a member of the European Union or the jurisdiction of
organization of the Borrower, so long as the amount of Indebtedness of the
Subsidiary Guarantor is not increased thereby and (2) a Subsidiary Guarantor may
merge amalgamate or consolidate with another Subsidiary Guarantor or the
Borrower.

           (c) Notwithstanding Sections 10.10(a) and (b) and Section 10.11
below, nothing in these Sections 10.10 and 10.11 shall prevent any Subsidiary
Transfer Transaction, which need not comply with Sections 10.10(a) or (b) and
10.11.

           10.11. SUCCESSOR COMPANY SUBSTITUTED.

           Upon any consolidation, merger or amalgamation, or any sale, lease,
conveyance or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the
Borrower in accordance or permitted by with Section 10.10 hereof, the Successor
Company (if other than the Borrower) shall succeed to and be substituted for,
and may exercise every right and power of, the Borrower under this Agreement
with the same effect as if such Successor Company had been named as the Borrower
herein.

           SECTION 11. [RESERVED].

           SECTION 12. EVENTS OF DEFAULT.

           12.1. EVENTS OF DEFAULT. An "EVENT OF DEFAULT" occurs if:

           (a) the Borrower defaults in any payment of interest on any Loan when
     the same becomes due and payable, and such default continues for a period
     of 30 days,

           (b) the Borrower defaults in the payment of principal or premium, if
     any, of any Loan when due at its Stated Maturity, upon optional redemption,
     upon required repurchase, upon declaration or otherwise,

           (c) the Borrower or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries fails to
     comply with any of its agreements in the Notes or this Agreement (other
     than those referred to in (a) or (b) above) and such failure continues for
     60 days after the notice specified below; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that to the
     extent such failure relates solely to an action or inaction by Intelsat
     General or another Government Business Subsidiary, and the Borrower and its
     Restricted Subsidiaries have otherwise complied with Section 9.19, no Event
     of Default shall occur,



                                       -92-
<PAGE>

           (d) Holdings, the Borrower or any Significant Subsidiary fails to pay
     any Indebtedness (other than Indebtedness owing to a Parent of the Borrower
     or a Restricted Subsidiary of the Borrower) within any applicable grace
     period after final maturity or the acceleration of any such Indebtedness by
     the holders thereof because of a default, in each case, if the total amount
     of such Indebtedness unpaid or accelerated exceeds $75.0 million or its
     foreign currency equivalent,

           (e) Holdings, the Borrower or any Significant Subsidiary pursuant to
     or within the meaning of any Bankruptcy Law:

                (i) commences a voluntary case;

                (ii) consents to the entry of an order for relief against it in
           an involuntary case;

                (iii) consents to the appointment of a Custodian of it or for
           any substantial part of its property; or

                (iv) makes a general assignment for the benefit of its creditors
           or takes any comparable action under any foreign laws relating to
           insolvency,

           (f) a court of competent jurisdiction enters an order or decree under
     any Bankruptcy Law that:

                (i) is for relief against Holdings, the Borrower or any
           Significant Subsidiary of the Borrower in an involuntary case;

                (ii) appoints a Custodian of Holdings, the Borrower or any
           Significant Subsidiary of the Borrower or for any substantial part of
           its property; or

                (iii) orders the winding up or liquidation of Holdings, the
           Borrower or any Significant Subsidiary of the Borrower;

     or any similar relief is granted under any foreign laws and the order or
     decree remains unstayed and in effect for 60 days, or

           (g) Holdings, the Borrower or any Significant Subsidiary fails to pay
     final judgments aggregating in excess of $75.0 million or its foreign
     currency equivalent (net of any amounts which are covered by enforceable
     insurance policies issued by solvent carriers), which judgments are not
     discharged, waived or stayed for a period of 60 days following the entry
     thereof.

           The foregoing shall constitute Events of Default whatever the reason
for any such Event of Default and whether it is voluntary or involuntary or is
effected by operation of law or pursuant to any judgment, decree or order of any
court or any order, rule or regulation of any administrative or governmental
body.



                                       -93-
<PAGE>

           The term "BANKRUPTCY LAW" means Title 11, United States Code, or any
similar U.S. Federal, state or any foreign law for the relief of debtors. The
term "CUSTODIAN" means any receiver, trustee, assignee, liquidator, custodian or
similar official under any Bankruptcy Law.

           A Default under clause (c) above shall not constitute an Event of
Default until the Administrative Agent or Lenders of at least 25% in principal
amount of the outstanding Loans notify the Borrower of the Default and the
Borrower does not cure such Default within the time specified in clause (c)
above after receipt of such notice. Such notice must specify the Default, demand
that it be remedied and state that such notice is a "Notice of Default". The
Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent, within thirty days after the
occurrence thereof, written notice in the form of an Officers' Certificate of
any event which is, or with the giving of notice or the lapse of time or both
would become, an Event of Default, its status and what action the Borrower is
taking or proposes to take with respect thereto.

           12.2. ACCELERATION. If an Event of Default (other than an Event of
Default specified in Section 12.1(e) or (f) with respect to the Borrower) occurs
and is continuing, the Administrative Agent or Lenders of at least 25% in
principal amount of outstanding Loans by notice to the Borrower, may declare the
principal of, premium, if any, and accrued but unpaid interest on all the Loans
to be due and payable. Upon such a declaration, such principal and interest
shall be due and payable immediately. If an Event of Default specified in
Section 12.1(e) or (f) with respect to the Borrower occurs, the principal of,
premium, if any, and interest on all the Loans shall ipso facto become and be
immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of
the Administrative Agent or any Lenders. The Required Lenders by notice to the
Administrative Agent may rescind an acceleration and its consequences if the
rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree and if all existing
Events of Default have been cured or waived except nonpayment of principal or
interest that has become due solely because of acceleration. No such rescission
shall affect any subsequent Default or impair any right consequent thereto.

           In the event of any Event of Default specified in Section 12.1(d),
such Event of Default and all consequences thereof (excluding, however, any
resulting payment default) shall be annulled, waived and rescinded,
automatically and without any action by the Administrative Agent or the Lenders,
if within 30 days after such Event of Default arose the Borrower delivers an
Officers' Certificate to the Administrative Agent stating that (x) the
Indebtedness or guarantee that is the basis for such Event of Default has been
discharged or (y) the holders thereof have rescinded or waived the acceleration,
notice or action (as the case may be) giving rise to such Event of Default or
(z) the default that is the basis for such Event of Default has been cured, it
being understood that in no event shall an acceleration of the principal amount
of the Loans as described above be annulled, waived or rescinded upon the
happening of any such events.

           12.3. OTHER REMEDIES. If an Event of Default occurs and is
continuing, the Administrative Agent may pursue any available remedy at law or
in equity to collect the payment of principal of or interest on the Loans or to
enforce the performance of any provision of the Loans or this Agreement.

           The Administrative Agent may maintain a proceeding even if it does
not possess any of the Loans or does not produce any of them in the proceeding.
A delay or omission by the



                                       -94-
<PAGE>

Administrative Agent or any Lender in exercising any right or remedy accruing
upon an Event of Default shall not impair the right or remedy or constitute a
waiver of or acquiescence in the Event of Default. No remedy is exclusive of any
other remedy. All available remedies are cumulative.

           12.4. WAIVER OF PAST DEFAULTS. Provided the Loans are not then due
and payable by reason of a declaration of acceleration, the Required Lenders by
notice to the Administrative Agent may waive an existing Default and its
consequences except (a) a Default in the payment of the principal of or interest
on a Note, (b) a Default arising from the failure to redeem or purchase any Loan
when required pursuant to the terms of this Indenture or (c) a Default in
respect of a provision that under Section 14.1 cannot be amended without the
consent of each Lender affected. When a Default is waived, it is deemed cured
and the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders will be restored to
their former positions and rights under this Agreement, but no such waiver shall
extend to any subsequent or other Default or impair any consequent right.

           12.5. CONTROL BY MAJORITY. The Required Lenders may direct the time,
method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the
Administrative Agent or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the
Administrative Agent. However, the Administrative Agent may refuse to follow any
direction that conflicts with law or this Agreement or, subject to Article 13,
that the Administrative Agent determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of
any other Lender or that would involve the Administrative Agent in personal
liability; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the Administrative Agent may take any other
action deemed proper by the Administrative Agent that is not inconsistent with
such direction. Prior to taking any action under this Agreement, the
Administrative Agent shall be entitled to indemnification satisfactory to it in
its sole discretion against all losses and expenses caused by taking or not
taking such action.

           12.6. LIMITATION ON SUITS.

           (a) Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal,
premium (if any) or interest when due, no Lender may pursue any remedy with
respect to this Agreement or the Loans unless:

           (i) the Lender gives to the Administrative Agent written notice
     stating that an Event of Default is continuing;

           (ii) the Lenders of at least 25% in principal amount of the
     outstanding Loans make a written request to the Administrative Agent to
     pursue the remedy;

           (iii) such Lender or Lenders offer to the Administrative Agent
     reasonable security or indemnity satisfactory to it against any loss,
     liability or expense;

           (iv) the Administrative Agent does not comply with the request within
     60 days after receipt of the request and the offer of security or
     indemnity; and

           (v) the Required Lenders do not give the Administrative Agent a
     direction inconsistent with the request during such 60-day period.



                                       -95-
<PAGE>

           (b) A Lender may not use this Agreement to prejudice the rights of
another Lender or to obtain a preference or priority over another Lender.

           12.7. RIGHTS OF THE LENDERS TO RECEIVE PAYMENT. Notwithstanding any
other provision of this Agreement, the right of any Lender to receive payment of
principal of and interest on the Loans held by such Lender, on or after the
respective due dates expressed or provided for in the Loans, or to bring suit
for the enforcement of any such payment on or after such respective dates, shall
not be impaired or affected without the consent of such Lender.

           12.8. PRIORITIES. If the Administrative Agent collects any money or
property pursuant to this Section 12, it shall pay out the money or property in
the following order:

           FIRST: to the Administrative Agent for amounts due under Section 13;

           SECOND: to Lenders for amounts due and unpaid on the Loans for
     principal, premium, if any, and interest, ratably, without preference or
     priority of any kind, according to the amounts due and payable on the Loans
     for principal and interest, respectively; and

           THIRD: to the Borrower or, to the extent the Administrative Agent
     collects any amount from any Guarantor, to such Guarantor.

           The Administrative Agent may fix a record date and payment date for
any payment to the Lenders pursuant to this Section. At least 15 days before
such record date, the Administrative Agent shall mail to each Lender and the
Borrower a notice that states the record date, the payment date and amount to be
paid.

           SECTION 13. THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT.

           13.1. APPOINTMENT. Each Lender hereby irrevocably designates and
appoints the Administrative Agent as the agent of such Lender under this
Agreement and the other Credit Documents, and each such Lender irrevocably
authorizes the Administrative Agent, in such capacity, to take such action on
its behalf under the provisions of this Agreement and the other Credit Documents
and to exercise such powers and perform such duties as are expressly delegated
to the Administrative Agent by the terms of this Agreement and the other Credit
Documents, together with such other powers as are reasonably incidental thereto.
Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary elsewhere in this Agreement, the
Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or responsibilities, except those
expressly set forth herein, or any fiduciary relationship with any Lender, and
no implied covenants, functions, responsibilities, duties, obligations or
liabilities shall be read into this Agreement or any other Credit Document or
otherwise exist against the Administrative Agent. The Syndication Agent, in its
capacity as such, shall have no obligations, duties or responsibilities under
this Agreement but shall be entitled to all benefits of this Section 13.

           13.2. DELEGATION OF DUTIES. The Administrative Agent may execute any
of its duties under this Agreement and the other Credit Documents by or through
agents or attorneys-in-fact and shall be entitled to advice of counsel
concerning all matters pertaining to such duties.



                                       -96-
<PAGE>

The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for the negligence or
misconduct of any agents or attorneys-in-fact selected by it with reasonable
care.

           13.3. EXCULPATORY PROVISIONS. Neither the Administrative Agent nor
any of its officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or
Affiliates shall be (a) liable for any action lawfully taken or omitted to be
taken by it or such Person under or in connection with this Agreement or any
other Credit Document (except for its or such Person's own gross negligence or
willful misconduct) or (b) responsible in any manner to any of the Lenders for
any recitals, statements, representations or warranties made by the Borrower or
any officer thereof contained in this Agreement or any other Credit Document or
in any certificate, report, statement or other document referred to or provided
for in, or received by the Administrative Agent under or in connection with,
this Agreement or any other Credit Document or for the value, validity,
effectiveness, genuineness, enforceability or sufficiency of this Agreement or
any other Credit Document or for any failure of the Borrower to perform its
obligations hereunder or thereunder. The Administrative Agent shall not be under
any obligation to any Lender to ascertain or to inquire as to the observance or
performance of any of the agreements contained in, or conditions of, this
Agreement or any other Credit Document, or to inspect the properties, books or
records of the Borrower.

           13.4. RELIANCE BY ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT. The Administrative Agent
shall be entitled to rely, and shall be fully protected in relying, upon any
writing, resolution, notice, consent, certificate, affidavit, letter, telecopy,
telex or teletype message, statement, order or other document or conversation
believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have been signed, sent or made
by the proper Person or Persons and upon advice and statements of legal counsel
(including counsel to the Borrower), independent accountants and other experts
selected by the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent may deem and
treat the Lender specified in the Register with respect to any amount owing
hereunder as the owner thereof for all purposes unless a written notice of
assignment, negotiation or transfer thereof shall have been filed with the
Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent shall be fully justified in
failing or refusing to take any action under this Agreement or any other Credit
Document unless it shall first receive such advice or concurrence of the
Required Lenders as it deems appropriate or it shall first be indemnified to its
satisfaction by the Lenders against any and all liability and expense that may
be incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to take any such action. The
Administrative Agent shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in
refraining from acting, under this Agreement and the other Credit Documents in
accordance with a request of the Required Lenders, and such request and any
action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding upon all the
Lenders and all future holders of the Loans.

           13.5. NOTICE OF DEFAULT. The Administrative Agent shall not be deemed
to have knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default
hereunder unless the Administrative Agent has received notice from a Lender or
the Borrower referring to this Agreement, describing such Default or Event of
Default and stating that such notice is a "notice of default." In the event that
the Administrative Agent receives such a notice, the Administrative Agent shall
give notice thereof to the Lenders. The Administrative Agent shall take such
action with respect to such Default or Event of Default as shall be reasonably
directed by the Required Lenders, PROVIDED that unless and until the
Administrative Agent shall have received such direc-



                                       -97-
<PAGE>

tions, the Administrative Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) take such
action, or refrain from taking such action, with respect to such Default or
Event of Default as it shall deem advisable in the best interests of the Lenders
(except to the extent that this Agreement requires that such action be taken
only with the approval of the Required Lenders or each of the Lenders, as
applicable).

           13.6. NON-RELIANCE ON ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT AND OTHER LENDERS. Each
Lender expressly acknowledges that neither the Administrative Agent nor any of
its officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or Affiliates has
made any representations or warranties to it and that no act by the
Administrative Agent hereinafter taken, including any review of the affairs of
the Borrower shall be deemed to constitute any representation or warranty by the
Administrative Agent to any Lender. Each Lender represents to the Administrative
Agent that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative
Agent or any other Lender, and based on such documents and information as it has
deemed appropriate, made its own appraisal of and investigation into the
business, operations, property, financial and other condition and
creditworthiness of the Borrower and made its own decision to make its Loans
hereunder and enter into this Agreement. Each Lender also represents that it
will, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any
other Lender, and based on such documents and information as it shall deem
appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit analysis, appraisals
and decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement and the other
Credit Documents, and to make such investigation as it deems necessary to inform
itself as to the business, operations, property, financial and other condition
and creditworthiness of the Borrower. Except for notices, reports and other
documents expressly required to be furnished to the Lenders by the
Administrative Agent hereunder, the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty
or responsibility to provide any Lender with any credit or other information
concerning the business, assets, operations, properties, financial condition,
prospects or creditworthiness of the Borrower that may come into the possession
of the Administrative Agent or any of its officers, directors, employees,
agents, attorneys-in-fact or Affiliates.

           13.7. INDEMNIFICATION. The Lenders agree to indemnify the
Administrative Agent in its capacity as such (to the extent not reimbursed by
the Borrower and without limiting the obligation of the Borrower to do so),
ratably according to their respective portions of the Loans held by such Lenders
in effect on the date on which indemnification is sought (or, if indemnification
is sought after the date upon which the Loans shall have been paid in full,
ratably in accordance with their respective portions of the Loans held by such
Lenders in effect immediately prior to such date), from and against any and all
liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits,
costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind whatsoever that may at any time
(including at any time following the payment of the Loans) be imposed on,
incurred by or asserted against the Administrative Agent in any way relating to
or arising out of, the Commitments, this Agreement, any of the other Credit
Documents or any documents contemplated by or referred to herein or therein or
the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or any action taken or omitted
by the Administrative Agent under or in connection with any of the foregoing,
PROVIDED that no Lender shall be liable for the payment of any portion of such
liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits,
costs, expenses or disbursements resulting from the Administrative Agent's gross
negligence or willful misconduct.



                                       -98-
<PAGE>

The agreements in this Section 13.7 shall survive the payment of the Loans and
all other amounts payable hereunder.

           13.8. ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT IN ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY. The
Administrative Agent and its Affiliates may make loans to, accept deposits from
and generally engage in any kind of business with the Borrower or any Guarantor
as though the Administrative Agent were not the Administrative Agent hereunder
and under the other Credit Documents. With respect to the Loans made by it, the
Administrative Agent shall have the same rights and powers under this Agreement
and the other Credit Documents as any Lender and may exercise the same as though
it were not the Administrative Agent, and the terms "Lender" and "Lenders" shall
include the Administrative Agent in its individual capacity.

           13.9. SUCCESSOR AGENT. The Administrative Agent may resign as
Administrative Agent upon 20 days' prior written notice to the Lenders and the
Borrower. If the Administrative Agent shall resign as Administrative Agent under
this Agreement and the other Credit Documents, then the Required Lenders shall
appoint from among the Lenders a successor agent for the Lenders, which
successor agent shall be approved by the Borrower (which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld) so long as no Default or Event of Default is continuing,
whereupon such successor agent shall succeed to the rights, powers and duties of
the Administrative Agent, and the term "Administrative Agent" shall mean such
successor agent effective upon such appointment and approval, and the former
Administrative Agent's rights, powers and duties as Administrative Agent shall
be terminated, without any other or further act or deed on the part of such
former Administrative Agent or any of the parties to this Agreement or any
holders of the Loans. After any retiring Administrative Agent's resignation as
Administrative Agent, the provisions of this Section 12 shall inure to its
benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was
Administrative Agent under this Agreement and the other Credit Documents.

           13.10. WITHHOLDING TAX. To the extent required by any applicable law,
the Administrative Agent may withhold from any interest payment to any Lender an
amount equivalent to any applicable withholding tax. If any Governmental
Authority asserts a claim that the Administrative Agent did not properly
withhold tax from amounts paid to or for the account of any Lender (because the
appropriate form was not delivered, was not properly executed, or because such
Lender failed to notify the Administrative Agent of a change in circumstances
which rendered the exemption from, or reduction of, withholding tax ineffective,
or for any other reason), such Lender shall indemnify the Administrative Agent
(to the extent that the Administrative Agent has not already been reimbursed by
the Borrower and without limiting the obligation of the Borrower to do so) fully
for all amounts paid, directly or indirectly, by the Administrative Agent as tax
or otherwise, including penalties and interest, together with all expenses
incurred, including legal expenses, allocated staff costs and any out of pocket
expenses.

           13.11. [RESERVED].

           13.12. TRUSTEE ACT 2000. Section 1 of the Trustee Act 2000 shall not
apply to the duties of the Administrative Agent in relation to the trusts
constituted by this Agreement. Where there are any inconsistencies between the
Trustee Act 1925 or the Trustee Act 2000 and the provisions of this Agreement,
the provisions of this Agreement shall, to the extent permitted by law,



                                       -99-
<PAGE>

prevail, and in the case of any inconsistency with the Trustee Act 2000, the
provisions of this Agreement shall constitute a restriction or exclusion for the
purposes of that Act.

           SECTION 14. MISCELLANEOUS.

           14.1. AMENDMENTS AND WAIVERS.

           (a) WITHOUT CONSENT OF THE LENDERS. The Borrower and the
Administrative Agent may amend this Agreement without notice to or consent of
any Lender:

           (i) to cure any ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency;

           (ii) to comply with Section 10.10;

           (iii) to add Guarantees with respect to the Loans or to secure the
     Loans;

           (iv) to add to the covenants of the Borrower for the benefit of the
     Lenders or to surrender any right or power herein conferred upon the
     Borrower;

           (v) to effect any provision of this Agreement (including to release
     any Guarantees in accordance with the terms of this Agreement);

           (vi) to make any change that does not adversely affect the rights of
     any Lender;

           (vii) to provide for the issuance of the Exchange Notes; or

           (viii) to release the Guarantee of any Parent of the Borrower.

           After an amendment under this Section 14.1(a) becomes effective, the
Borrower shall mail to Lenders a notice briefly describing such amendment. The
failure to give such notice to all Lenders, or any defect therein, shall not
impair or affect the validity of an amendment under this Section 14.1(a).

           (b) WITH CONSENT OF THE LENDERS. The Borrower and the Administrative
Agent may amend this Agreement with the written consent of the Required Lenders.
However, without the consent of each Lender of an outstanding Loan affected, an
amendment may not:

           (i) reduce the amount of Loans whose Lenders must consent to an
     amendment,

           (ii) reduce the rate of or extend the time for payment of interest on
     any Loan,

           (iii) reduce the principal of or change the Stated Maturity of any
     Loan,

           (iv) make any Loan payable in money other than that stated in such
     Loan,



                                      -100-
<PAGE>

           (v) make any change in Section 12.4 or 12.7 or the second sentence of
     this Section 14.1(b), or

           (vi) expressly subordinate the Loans or any Guarantee to any other
     Indebtedness of the Borrower or any Guarantor.

           It shall not be necessary for the consent of the Lenders under this
Section 14.1(b) to approve the particular form of any proposed amendment, but it
shall be sufficient if such consent approves the substance thereof.

           After an amendment under this Section 14.1(b) becomes effective, the
Administrative Agent shall provide to the Lenders a notice briefly describing
such amendment. The failure to give such notice to all Lenders entitled to
receive such notice, or any defect therein, shall not impair or affect the
validity of an amendment under this Section 14.1(b).

           (c) Neither the Borrower or any Affiliate of the Borrower shall,
directly or indirectly, pay or cause to be paid any consideration, whether by
way of interest, fee or otherwise, to any Lender for or as an inducement to any
consent, waiver or amendment of any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement
or the Notes unless such consideration is offered to be paid to all Lenders that
so consent, waive or agree to amend in the time frame set forth in solicitation
documents relating to such consent, waiver or agreement.

           (d) All Lenders holding Loans issued under this Agreement shall vote
and consent together on all matters (as to which any such Loans may vote) as one
class and no Lenders will have the right to vote or consent as a separate class
on any matter.

           14.2. NOTICES. Except as set forth in Section 14.17, all notices,
requests and demands to or upon the respective parties hereto to be effective

delay in exercising, on the part of the Administrative Agent or any Lender, any

not exclusive of any rights, remedies, powers and privileges provided by law.

           14.4. SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. All representations

           14.5. PAYMENT OF EXPENSES AND TAXES. The Borrower agrees (a) to pay
or reimburse the Agents for all their reasonable out-of-pocket costs and
expenses incurred in connection with the development, preparation and execution
of, and any amendment, supplement or modification to, this Agreement and the
other Credit Documents and any other documents prepared in connection herewith
or therewith, and the consummation and administration of the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby, including the reasonable fees, disbursements
and other charges of counsel to the Agents, (b) to pay or reimburse each Lender
and Agent for all its reasonable and documented costs and expenses incurred in
connection with the enforcement or preservation of any rights under this
Agreement, the other Credit Documents and any such other documents, including
the reasonable fees, disbursements and other charges of counsel to each Lender
and of counsel to the Agents, (c) to pay, indemnify, and hold harmless each
Lender and Agent from, any and all recording and filing fees and (d) to pay,
indemnify, and hold harmless each Lender and Agent and their respective

limitation, any of the foregoing relating to the violation of, noncompliance
with or liability under, any Environmental Law or to any actual or alleged
presence, release or threatened release of Hazardous Materials involving or
attributable to the operations of the Borrower, any of its Subsidiaries or any
of the Real Estate (all the foregoing in this clause (d), collectively, the
"INDEMNIFIED LIABILITIES"), PROVIDED that the Borrower shall have no obligation
hereunder to the Administrative Agent or any Lender nor any of their respective
directors, officers, employees and agents with respect to indemnified
liabilities to the extent attributable to (i) the gross negligence or willful
misconduct of the party to be indemnified as determined in a final and
non-appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction or (ii) disputes
among the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and/or their transferees. The
agreements in this Section 14.5 shall survive repayment of the Loans and all
other amounts payable hereunder.

           14.6. SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS; PARTICIPATIONS AND ASSIGNMENTS.

           (a) The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure
to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns
permitted hereby, except that (i) the Borrower may not assign or otherwise
transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written
consent of each Lender (and any attempted assignment or transfer by the Borrower
or without such consent shall be null and void) and (ii) no Lender may assign or
otherwise transfer its rights or obligations hereunder except in accordance with
this Section 14.6. Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, shall be
construed to confer upon any Person (other than the parties hereto, their
respective successors and assigns permitted hereby and to the Participants (to
the extent provided in paragraph (c) of this Section 14.6) any legal or
equitable right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement.

           (b) (i) Subject to the conditions set forth in paragraph (b)(ii)
below, any Lender may assign to one or more assignees all or a portion of its
rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its
Commitments and the Loans at the time owing to



                                      -103-
<PAGE>

it) prior to the Initial Maturity Date (other than to a "Disqualified Lender"
(as defined in the Commitment Letter referred to in the Fee Letter)) only (i)
after consultation with the Borrower and (ii) provided the Initial Lenders,
after giving effect to any such assignment, continue to hold at least 51% of the
aggregate principal amount of Loans outstanding under this Agreement:

           (ii) Assignments shall be subject to the following additional
     conditions:

           (A) except in the case of an assignment to a Lender, an Affiliate of
     a Lender or an Approved Fund, the amount of the Loans of the assigning
     Lender subject to each such assignment (determined as of the date the
     Assignment and Acceptance with respect to such assignment is delivered to
     the Administrative Agent) shall not be less than $1.0 million , and
     increments of $1.0 million in excess thereof, unless each of the Borrower
     and the Administrative Agent otherwise consents (which consents shall not
     be unreasonably withheld or delayed), PROVIDED that no such consent of the
     Borrower shall be required if an Event of Default under Section 12.1 has
     occurred and is continuing; PROVIDED, FURTHER, that contemporaneous
     assignments to a single assignee made by Affiliates of Lenders and related
     Approved Funds shall be aggregated for purposes of meeting the minimum
     assignment amount requirements stated above;

           (B) each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of a
     proportionate part of all the assigning Lender's rights and obligations
     under this Agreement;

           (C) the parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to the
     Administrative Agent an Assignment and Acceptance, together with a
     processing and recordation fee of $3,500, PROVIDED that only one such fee
     shall be payable in the event of simultaneous assignments to or from two or
     more Approved Funds; and

           (D) the assignee, if it shall not be a Lender, shall deliver to the
     Administrative Agent an administrative questionnaire in a form approved by
     the Administrative Agent (the "ADMINISTRATIVE QUESTIONNAIRE").

           For the purpose of this Section 14.6(b), the term "APPROVED FUND"
means any Person (other than a natural person) that is engaged in making,
purchasing, holding or investing in bank loans and similar extensions of credit
in the ordinary course and that is administered, advised or managed by (a) a
Lender, (b) an Affiliate of a Lender or (c) an entity or an Affiliate of an
entity that administers, advises or manages a Lender.

           (iii) Subject to acceptance and recording thereof pursuant to
paragraph (b)(v) of this Section 14.6, from and after the effective date
specified in each Assignment and Acceptance, the assignee thereunder shall be a
party hereto and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and
Acceptance, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement,
and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest
assigned by such Assignment and Acceptance, be released from its obligations
under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Acceptance covering
all of the assigning Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement, such
Lender shall cease to be a party hereto but shall continue to be entitled to the
benefits of Sections 2.10, 2.11, 5.4 and 14.5). Any assignment or transfer by a
Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with
this Section 14.6



                                      -104-
<PAGE>

shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a
participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with paragraph (c) of
this Section 14.6.

           (iv) The Administrative Agent, acting for this purpose as an agent of
the Borrower shall maintain at the Administrative Agent's Office a copy of each
Assignment and Acceptance delivered to it and a register for the recordation of
the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitments of, and principal
amount of the Loans (the "REGISTER"). Further, the Register shall contain the
name and address of the Administrative Agent and the lending office through
which each such Person acts under this Agreement. The entries in the Register
shall be conclusive, and the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders
may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the
terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement,
notwithstanding notice to the contrary. The Register shall be available for
inspection by the Borrower and any Lender, at any reasonable time and from time
to time upon reasonable prior notice.

           (v) Upon its receipt of a duly completed Assignment and Acceptance
executed by an assigning Lender and an assignee, the assignee's completed
Administrative Questionnaire (unless the assignee shall already be a Lender
hereunder), the processing and recordation fee referred to in paragraph (b) of
this Section 14.6 and any written consent to such assignment required by
paragraph (b) of this Section 14.6, the Administrative Agent shall accept such
Assignment and Acceptance and record the information contained therein in the
Register. No assignment shall be effective for purposes of this Agreement unless
it has been recorded in the Register as provided in this paragraph.

           (c) (i) Any Lender may, without the consent of the Borrower or the
Administrative Agent, sell participations to one or more banks or other entities
(each, a "PARTICIPANT") in all or a portion of such Lender's rights and
obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitments
and the Loans owing to it), PROVIDED that (A) such Lender's obligations under
this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (B) such Lender shall remain solely
responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations
and (C) the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the other Lenders shall
continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such
Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement. Any agreement or
instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide
that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to
approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement
or any other Credit Document, PROVIDED that such agreement or instrument may
provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree
to any amendment, modification or waiver described in the first proviso to
Section 14.1 that affects such Participant. Subject to paragraph (c)(ii) of this
Section 14.6, the Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the
benefits of Sections 2.10, 2.11 and 5.4 to the same extent as if it were a
Lender (subject to the requirements of those Sections) and had acquired its
interest by assignment pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section 14.6. To the
extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits
of Section 14.8(b) as though it were a Lender, PROVIDED such Participant agrees
to be subject to Section 14.8(a) as though it were a Lender. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, on and prior to the Initial Maturity Date, the Initial Lenders shall
retain at least 51% of the voting rights for all Loans issued under this
Agreement (subject to allowances for customary participation voting rights).



                                      -105-
<PAGE>

           (ii) A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater
payment under Section 2.10 or 5.4 than the applicable Lender would have been
entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant,
unless the sale of the participation to such Participant is made with the
Borrower's prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld).

           (d) Any Lender may, without the consent of the Borrower or the
Administrative Agent, at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or
any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations of such
Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal
Reserve Bank, and this Section 14.6 shall not apply to any such pledge or
assignment of a security interest, PROVIDED that no such pledge or assignment of
a security interest shall release a Lender from any of its obligations hereunder
or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto. In
order to facilitate such pledge or assignment, the Borrower hereby agrees that,
upon request of any Lender at any time and from time to time after the Borrower
has made its initial borrowing hereunder, the Borrower shall provide to such
Lender, at the Borrower's own expense, a promissory note, substantially in the
form of EXHIBIT E.

           (e) Subject to Section 14.16, the Borrower authorizes each Lender to
disclose to any Participant, secured creditor of such Lender or assignee (each,
a "TRANSFEREE") and any prospective Transferee any and all financial information
in such Lender's possession concerning the Borrower and its Affiliates that has
been delivered to such Lender by or on behalf of the Borrower and its Affiliates
pursuant to this Agreement or which has been delivered to such Lender by or on
behalf of the Borrower and its Affiliates in connection with such Lender's
credit evaluation of the Borrower and its Affiliates prior to becoming a party
to this Agreement.

           (f) Each Lender hereby agrees that it shall not transfer, assign or
participate any Loan to any Person other than a "Qualified Institutional Buyer"
(as defined under Rule 144A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended) or an
"accredited investor" (as defined under Regulation D), or otherwise pursuant to
a similar exemption under the Securities Act, and the Administrative Agent
agrees that it will not facilitate any transfer other than in compliance with
this sentence.

           14.7. REPLACEMENTS OF LENDERS UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES.

           (a) The Borrower shall be permitted to replace any Lender that (a)
requests reimbursement for amounts owing pursuant to Section 2.10, 2.12 or 5.4,
(b) is affected in the manner described in Section 2.10(a)(iii) and as a result
thereof of any of the actions described in such Section is required to be taken
or (c) becomes a Defaulting Lender, with a replacement bank or other financial
institution, provided that (i) such replacement does not conflict with any
Requirement of Law, (ii) no Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing at the time of such replacement, (iii) the Borrower shall repay (or
the replacement bank or institution shall purchase, at par) all Loans and other
amounts (other than an disputed amounts), pursuant to Section 2.10, 2.11, 2.12
or 5.4, as the case may be) owing to such replaced Lender prior to the date of
replacement, (iv) the replacement bank or institution, if not already a Lender,
and the terms and conditions of such replacement, shall be reasonably
satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, (v) the replaced Lender shall be
obligated to make such replacement in accordance with the provi-



                                      -106-
<PAGE>

sions of Section 14.6 (provided that the Borrower shall be obligated to pay the
registration and processing fee referred to therein) and (vi) any such
replacement shall not be deemed to be a waiver of any rights that the Borrower,
the Administrative Agent or any other Lender shall have against the replaced
Lender.

           (b) If any Lender (such Lender, a "NON-CONSENTING LENDER") has failed
to consent to a proposed amendment, waiver, discharge or termination which
pursuant to the terms of Section 14.1(b) requires the consent of all of the
Lenders affected and with respect to which the Required Lenders shall have
granted their consent, then provided no Event of Default (other than any Event
of Default to be cured by such amendment, waiver, discharge or termination) then
exists, the Borrower shall have the right (unless such Non Consenting Lender
grants such consent) to replace such Non Consenting Lender by deeming such Non
Consenting Lender to have assigned its Loans, and its Commitments hereunder to
one or more assignees, reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent,
provided that: (a) all Obligations of the Borrower owing to such Non Consenting
Lender being replaced shall be paid in full to such Non Consenting Lender
concurrently with such assignment, and (b) the replacement Lender shall purchase
the foregoing by paying to such Non Consenting Lender a price equal to the
principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon. No action by
or consent of the Non Consenting Lender shall be necessary in connection with
such assignment, which shall be immediately and automatically effective upon
payment of such purchase price. In connection with any such assignment, the
Borrower, Administrative Agent, such Non Consenting Lender and the replacement
Lender shall otherwise comply with Section 14.6.

           14.8. ADJUSTMENTS; SET-OFF.

           (a) If any Lender (a "BENEFITED LENDER") shall at any time receive
any payment of all or part of its Loans, or interest thereon, or receive any
collateral in respect thereof (whether voluntarily or involuntarily, by set-off,
pursuant to events or proceedings of the nature referred to in Article 12, or
otherwise), in a greater proportion than any such payment to or collateral
received by any other Lender, if any, in respect of such other Lender's Loans,
or interest thereon, such benefited Lender shall purchase for cash from the
other Lenders a participating interest in such portion of each such other
Lender's Loan, or shall provide such other Lenders with the benefits of any such
collateral, or the proceeds thereof, as shall be necessary to cause such
benefited Lender to share the excess payment or benefits of such collateral or
proceeds ratably with each of the Lenders; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that if all or any
portion of such excess payment or benefits is thereafter recovered from such
benefited Lender, such purchase shall be rescinded, and the purchase price and
benefits returned, to the extent of such recovery, but without interest.

           (b) After the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of
Default, in addition to any rights and remedies of the Lenders provided by law,
each Lender shall have the right, without prior notice to the Borrower, any such
notice being expressly waived by the Borrower to the extent permitted by
applicable law, upon any amount becoming due and payable by the Borrower
hereunder (whether at the stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) to
set-off and appropriate and apply against such amount any and all deposits
(general or special, time or demand, provisional or final), in any currency, and
any other credits, indebtedness or claims, in any currency, in each case whether
direct or indirect, absolute or contingent, matured or un-



                                      -107-
<PAGE>

matured, at any time held or owing by such Lender or any branch or agency
thereof to or for the credit or the account of the Borrower. Each Lender agrees
promptly to notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent after any such
set-off and application made by such Lender, PROVIDED that the failure to give
such notice shall not affect the validity of such set-off and application.

           14.9. COUNTERPARTS. This Agreement may be executed by one or more of
the parties to this Agreement on any number of separate counterparts (including
by facsimile or other electronic transmission), and all of said counterparts
taken together shall be deemed to constitute one and the same instrument. A set
of the copies of this Agreement signed by all the parties shall be lodged with
the Borrower and the Administrative Agent.

           14.10. SEVERABILITY. Any provision of this Agreement that is
prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction,
be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without
invalidating the remaining provisions hereof, and any such prohibition or
unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render
unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction.

           14.11. INTEGRATION. This Agreement and the other Credit Documents
represent the agreement of the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the
Lenders with respect to the subject matter hereof, and there are no promises,
undertakings, representations or warranties by the Borrower, the Administrative
Agent or any Lender relative to subject matter hereof not expressly set forth or
referred to herein or in the other Credit Documents.

           14.12. GOVERNING LAW. THIS AGREEMENT AND THE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS
OF THE PARTIES HEREUNDER SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED AND INTERPRETED IN
ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.

           14.13. SUBMISSION TO JURISDICTION; CONSENT TO SERVICE; WAIVERS.

           (a) The Borrower hereby irrevocably and unconditionally:

           (i) submits for itself and its property in any legal action or
     proceeding relating to this Agreement and the other Credit Documents to
     which it is a party, or for recognition and enforcement of any judgment in
     respect thereof, to the non-exclusive general jurisdiction of the courts of
     the State of New York, the courts of the United States of America for the
     Southern District of New York and appellate courts from any thereof;

           (ii) consents that any such action or proceeding may be brought in
     such courts and waives any objection that it may now or hereafter have to
     the venue of any such action or proceeding in any such court or that such
     action or proceeding was brought in an inconvenient court and agrees not to
     plead or claim the same;

           (iii) agrees that service of process in any such action or proceeding
     may be effected by mailing a copy thereof by registered or certified mail
     (or any substantially similar form of mail), postage prepaid, to the
     Borrower at its address set forth in Section 14.2



                                      -108-
<PAGE>

     or at such other address of which the Administrative Agent shall have been
     notified pursuant thereto;

           (iv) agrees that nothing herein shall affect the right to effect
     service of process in any other manner permitted by law or shall limit the
     right to sue in any other jurisdiction; and

           (v) waives, to the maximum extent not prohibited by law, any right it
     may have to claim or recover in any legal action or proceeding referred to
     in this Section 14.13 any special, exemplary, punitive or consequential
     damages.

           (b) By the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Borrower
acknowledges that it has by separate written instrument, designated and
appointed CT Corporation System, 1633 Broadway, New York, NY 10019 (and any
successor entity), as its authorized agent upon which process may be served in
any suit or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the
Credit Documents that may be instituted in any federal or state court in the
State of New York.

           (c) The Borrower, to the extent that it has or hereafter may acquire
any immunity (sovereign or otherwise) from any legal action, suit or proceeding,
from jurisdiction of any court or from setoff or any legal process (whether
service of notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution
of judgment, execution of judgment or otherwise) with respect to itself or any
of its property or assets, hereby waives and agrees not to plead or claim such
immunity in respect of its obligations under this Agreement and the other Credit
Documents (it being understood that the waivers contained in this paragraph (c)
shall have the fullest extent permitted under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities
Act of 1976, as amended, and are intended to be irrevocable and not subject to
withdrawal for the purposes of such Act).

           14.14. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS. The Borrower hereby acknowledges that:

           (a) it has been advised by counsel in the negotiation, execution and
delivery of this Agreement and the other Credit Documents;

           (b) neither the Administrative Agent nor any Lender has any fiduciary
relationship with or duty to the Borrower arising out of or in connection with
this Agreement or any of the other Credit Documents, and the relationship
between Administrative Agent and Lenders, on one hand, and the Borrower, on the
other hand, in connection herewith or therewith is solely that of debtor and
creditor; and

           (c) no joint venture is created hereby or by the other Credit
Documents or otherwise exists by virtue of the transactions contemplated hereby
among the Lenders or among the Borrower and the Lenders.

LATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER CREDIT DOCUMENT AND FOR ANY COUNTERCLAIM
THEREIN.

           14.16. CONFIDENTIALITY. The Administrative Agent and each Lender
shall hold all non-public information furnished by or on behalf of the Borrower
in connection with such Lender's evaluation of whether to become a Lender
hereunder or obtained by such Lender or the Administrative Agent pursuant to the
requirements of this Agreement ("CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION"), confidential in
accordance with its customary procedure for handling confidential information of
this nature and (in the case of a Lender that is a bank) in accordance with safe
and sound banking practices and in any event may make disclosure as required or
requested by any governmental agency or representative thereof or pursuant to
legal process or to such Lender's or the Administrative Agent's attorneys,
professional advisors or independent auditors or Affiliates, PROVIDED that
unless specifically prohibited by applicable law or court order, each Lender and
the Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower of any request by any
governmental agency or representative thereof (other than any such request in
connection with an examination of the financial condition of such Lender by such
governmental agency) for disclosure of any such non-public information prior to
disclosure of such information, and PROVIDED, FURTHER, that in no event shall
any Lender or the Administrative Agent be obligated or required to return any
materials furnished by Holdings, the Borrower or any Subsidiary of the Borrower.
Each Lender and the Administrative Agent agrees that it will not provide to
prospective Transferees or to prospective direct or indirect contractual
counterparties in swap agreements to be entered into in connection with Loans
made hereunder any of the Confidential Information unless such Person is advises
of and agrees to be bound by the provisions of this Section 14.16.

           14.17. [RESERVED].

           14.18. USA PATRIOT ACT. Each Lender hereby notifies Holdings and the
Borrower that pursuant to the requirements of the USA Patriot Act (Title III of
Pub. L. 107-56 (signed into law October 26, 2001)) (the "PATRIOT ACT"), it is
required to obtain, verify and record information that identifies the Borrower,
which information includes the name and address of the Borrower and other
information that will allow such Lender to identify the Borrower in accordance
with the Patriot Act.

           14.19. CONVERSION OF CURRENCIES.

           (a) If, for the purpose of obtaining judgment in any court, it is
necessary to convert a sum owing hereunder in one currency into another
currency, each party hereto agrees, to the fullest extent that it may
effectively do so, that the rate of exchange used shall be that at which in
accordance with normal banking procedures in the relevant jurisdiction the first
currency could be purchased with such other currency on the Business Day
immediately preceding the day on which final judgment is given.

           (b) The obligations of the Borrower in respect of any sum due to any
party hereto or any holder of the obligations owing hereunder (the "APPLICABLE
CREDITOR") shall, notwithstanding any judgment in a currency (the "JUDGMENT
CURRENCY") other than the currency in which such sum is stated to be due
hereunder (the "AGREEMENT CURRENCY"), be discharged only to the extent that, on
the Business Day following receipt by the Applicable Creditor of any sum
ad-



                                      -110-
<PAGE>

judged to be so due in the Judgment Currency, the Applicable Creditor may in
accordance with normal banking procedures in the relevant jurisdiction purchase
the Agreement Currency with the Judgment Currency; if the amount of the
Agreement Currency so purchased is less than the sum originally due to the
Applicable Creditor in the Agreement Currency, the Borrower agrees, as a
separate obligation and notwithstanding any such judgment, to indemnify the
Applicable Creditor against such loss. The obligations of the Borrower contained
in this Section 14.19 shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the
payment of all other amounts owing hereunder.

           (c) For purposes of this Agreement, the Dollar Equivalent of the
Stated Amount of any Letter of Credit shall be calculated on the date when such
Letter of Credit is issued, on the first Business Day of each month and at such
other times as designated by the Administrative Agent. Such Dollar Equivalent
shall remain in effect until the same is recalculated by the Administrative
Agent as provided above and notice of such recalculation is received by the
Borrower, it being understood that until such notice is received, the Dollar
Equivalent shall be as last reported by the Administrative Agent to the
Borrower. The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower of each
such determination of Dollar Equivalents.


                                      -111-
