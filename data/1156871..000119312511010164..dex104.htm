therefor, and such sale may, without further notice, be made at the time and place to which it was so adjourned. To the extent permitted by law, each Grantor hereby waives any claim against the Collateral Trustee arising by reason of the fact that
the price at which any Collateral may have been sold at such a private sale was less than the price that might have been obtained at a public sale, even if the Collateral Trustee accepts the first offer received and does not offer such Collateral to
more than one offeree. Each Grantor further agrees, at the request of the Collateral Trustee or the Administrative Agent to assemble the Collateral and make it available to the Collateral Trustee, at places which the Collateral Trustee shall
reasonably select, whether at such Grantor&#146;s premises or elsewhere. The Collateral Trustee shall apply the net proceeds of any action taken by it pursuant to this Section&nbsp;6.5 in accordance with the provisions of Section&nbsp;6.4.
