that CME can receive input from CBOT as to performance bond / margin requirements. Such process shall involve monthly meetings with representatives designated by CBOT and will involve data analysis and discussions with respect to how and when to
implement changes to clearing firm level performance bond / margin requirements; provided however, that ultimate control over performance bond / margin requirements at the clearing member level shall reside with CME. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
CME agrees that determinations by CME with respect to performance bond / margin requirements for CBOT Core Products shall be made strictly on the basis of risk management principles and shall not involve competitive considerations associated with
CME products and competing CBOT Products. Additionally, CME shall not recognize clearing member level spreads between CBOT Products and products of any other exchange without the prior written approval of CBOT. </FONT></P> <P

only if time permits. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2"><U>Transfers</U>. CME shall effect the transfer of positions in CBOT Products between Special CME Clearing Members, where
applicable, in accordance with the CME Rules and Operational Policies and Procedures in effect from time to time. Transferred positions will be guaranteed by CME to the transferee only upon payment of initial settlement variation and performance
bond by the transferor or the transferee, as applicable. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2"><U>Give-Up Transactions</U>. CME will make the allocate claim system (&#147;ACS&#148;) available

inventory of deliverable supply, delivery intent processing, delivery assignment, and delivery invoicing, except that CBOT shall maintain responsibility for management and operation of the registration and delivery process. CME will provide
automated deliveries support as of the Launch Date of financial and equity CBOT Products that are listed for trading by CBOT as of the Effective Date. CME will use its best efforts to implement automated deliveries support of other CBOT Products
that are listed for trading by CBOT as of the Effective Date, including agricultural products, as of the Launch Date or as soon thereafter as is practicable. CME shall provide automated deliveries support for new CBOT Products (or for changed
features of existing CBOT Products) listed for trading by CBOT after the Effective Date, provided that the product characteristics permit automation of deliveries management through means substantially similar to those that CME then employs with
respect to other products cleared by CME. If significant development work will be required by CME to provide automated deliveries support for such products listed for trading by CBOT after the Effective Date, the work will be subject to the change

settlement bank relationship with Lakeside Bank and, as appropriate, Burling Bank, prior to the Launch Date. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2"><U>Large Trader Reports</U>. CME will collect
on CBOT&#146;s behalf the large trader submissions from Special CME Clearing Members or their clients and forward such submissions to the CFTC and to CBOT for regulatory purposes. The CME clearing house shall be authorized to use this data to
perform the type of account level stress testing it performs on its own products to identify concentration of client exposure at a clearing member. CME shall facilitate reporting of large trader data for CBOT products by accepting transmissions of
such data in standard formats. CME shall construct an application that maintains a database of firms, customer accounts, and EINs (the term CBOT uses for the number used to aggregate customer accounts by beneficial owner). For each reported
position, the application shall search in the database by the firm and customer account: a) if the firm and customer account is found, the application shall tag the position with the EIN for it; and b) if the firm and customer account is not found,
the application shall assign the EIN, using CBOT&#146;s standard convention, and tag the position with the newly-assigned EIN. The application shall then prepare a datafile of reported positions for transmission to CBOT, with each position tagged
with its EIN. The application shall further provide CBOT staff with an interface for viewing and modifying the EIN assigned to a particular firm and customer account. CBOT shall provide an initial datafile or files for loading this application with
its existing EINs and their associated firm and customer accounts. CME shall prepare position limit reports against the large trader data for provision to CBOT. Other than these enumerated processes, all responsibility for large trader reporting
analysis and other larger trader-related functions remains with CBOT. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2"><U>Calculation and Collection of Fees</U>. CME will calculate, bill and collect
clearing fees from Special CME Clearing Members for transactions in CBOT Products, using the transaction types for which CME currently bills clearing members with respect to transactions in its own products. The rate billed will be determined by
CBOT for the fee for initial cleared transactions, including block trades, EFPs and other alternative execution procedures, and by CME for post-trade transaction types (including, without limitation, give-ups, transfers, option exercise and
assignment, and deliveries). </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2"><U>Operational Timeline</U>. Except as otherwise set forth in the CME Rules or the Operational Policies and Procedures, the
operational timeline for clearing services and submission of reports for transactions and positions in CBOT Products shall be the same as it is with respect to transactions and positions for CME products. CME anticipates using single, combined
clearing process cycles for both CME products and CBOT Products. Consequently, CME&#146;s deadlines and requirements shall apply with respect to processes including, but not limited to, trade report submission deadlines, out-trade report production,
final reconciliation and option exercise deadlines, mark-to-market </FONT>

fractional price formats and variable cabinet pricing. CME shall similarly support new product features and characteristics of existing CBOT Products or those that CBOT may list for trading in the future, provided, however, that if the features and

security deposits of Special CME Clearing Members and to further exercise certain limited assessment powers in the event of a default by either a Special CME Clearing Member or a CME clearing member. For the avoidance of doubt, CME shall manage a
joint security deposit pool for the benefit of Special CME Clearing Members and CME clearing members with respect to transactions in CME products, transactions in CBOT Products, and transactions in the products of any other exchange for which CME
provides clearing services or linked clearing, unless CME&#146;s agreement with such other exchange prohibits a joint guarantee fund. Consequently, the security deposit contributions of CME-only clearing members may be assessed as a result of
defaults as to transactions in CBOT Products, and the contributions of CBOT-only clearing members who are Special CME Clearing Members may be assessed as a result of defaults as to transactions in CME products. </FONT></P> <P

CME will provide support for and will participate in cross-margining of positions in CBOT Products held by Special CME Clearing Members under any other cross-margining agreements (or amendments to existing agreements) into which CBOT may enter in
the future, provided that (i)&nbsp;such support, including without limitation the development of necessary interfaces, shall be subject to the change request procedures set forth in Section&nbsp;3.10, and (ii)&nbsp;CME may decline to support such

basis throughout the development period prior to the Launch Date, the Parties will use their best efforts to update the project development plan (the &#147;Plan&#148;, as updated from time to time during the development period). The Plan shall
identify, with reasonable detail, (i)&nbsp;all material information that must be exchanged between the Parties, (ii)&nbsp;any outstanding matters that must be agreed to between the Parties or decisions that must be reached by one Party,
(iii)&nbsp;all material tasks that must be completed by either Party, and (iv)&nbsp;the timeline upon which such tasks must be completed in order to meet the Launch Date. The Parties shall also use their best efforts to jointly develop and
incorporate within the Plan an (i)&nbsp;outline and timeline for completing legal documentation, including necessary regulatory filings and any documentation that must be executed by Special CME Clearing Members or other entities, and (ii)&nbsp;and
outline and timeline for other communications with Special CME Clearing Members, ISVs, market data vendors, back-office service bureaus and any other entity with which information must be shared in order to effectuate a successful launch of Clearing

A failure to meet a particular internal deadline set forth in the Plan by either Party shall not be deemed a Material Breach of this Agreement. However, if either Party concludes that a serious failure or multiple failures to conform to the tasks
and timelines set forth in the Plan jeopardizes the Parties&#146; ability to meet the Launch Date, the concerned Party shall so notify the relevant management personnel of the other Party (including the individuals identified in Section&nbsp;19.5)
in writing, which may be by e-mail, and the Parties shall use reasonable efforts to resolve the matter and adjust the Plan to the concerned Party&#146;s satisfaction. If such efforts are not successful, the concerned Party may, not sooner than ten
(10)&nbsp;business days after delivering the notice, submit the matter to arbitration. If the arbitrator concludes that one of the Parties is primarily and substantially at fault for the failure and that the failure does jeopardize the Launch Date,
the other Party shall have the option to terminate this Agreement for an Unexcused Breach under Section&nbsp;10.1, without application of any notice and cure period. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:24px;margin-bottom:0px" ALIGN="center"><FONT
