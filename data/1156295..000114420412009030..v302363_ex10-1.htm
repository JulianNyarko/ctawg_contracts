<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt; text-align: center"><B>INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENT</B></P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt; text-indent: 0.5in">This Agreement is made as of February
__, 2012 by and between SeraCare Life Sciences, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the &ldquo;<B>Corporation</B>&rdquo;), and _____________________
(the &ldquo;<B>Indemnitee</B>&rdquo;), a director or officer of the Corporation.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt; text-indent: 0.5in">WHEREAS, the stockholders of the Corporation
have determined, by virtue of their adoption of Article VII of the Corporation&rsquo;s Certificate of Incorporation, that the Corporation
should indemnify the directors and officers of the Corporation to the fullest extent permitted under and in accordance with the
laws of the State of Delaware by reason of the fact that they are or were directors or officers of the Corporation;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt; text-indent: 0.5in">WHEREAS, the high frequency of litigation
against directors and officers of corporations with publicly traded securities has made prudent and experienced persons more reluctant
to serve or to continue to serve as directors or officers of such a corporation unless they are provided with adequate protections,
generally in the form of indemnification and insurance, against claims and actions against them with respect to their service as
a director or officer of such a corporation or in another capacity on behalf of or at the request of such a corporation;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt; text-indent: 0.5in">WHEREAS, the Corporation wishes to take
steps to ensure that it will continue to benefit from the services of its directors and officers and believes that a contractual
commitment to them to provide the maximum indemnification permitted by law would help to secure their continued service by reducing
any concerns that they may have regarding the risk of personal liability arising from potential claims or actions against them
with respect to their service for or on behalf of the Corporation or at its request;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt; text-indent: 0.5in">WHEREAS, neither the General Corporation
Law of the State of Delaware (the &ldquo;<B>General Corporation Law</B>&rdquo;) nor the Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation
sets forth a complete statement of the procedures that a corporation should or may wish to follow with respect to indemnification
of and advancement of expenses to its directors and officers, and the Corporation believes it prudent and in the best interests
of its stockholders for the Corporation to specify, in advance of any claim for indemnification or advancement of expenses, certain
procedures therefor, which the Corporation believes will reduce the likelihood of a dispute between the Corporation and its directors
and officers regarding any claim for indemnification or advancement of expenses; and</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt; text-indent: 0.5in">WHEREAS, the Corporation desires the
Indemnitee to serve, or to continue to serve, as a director or officer of the Corporation,</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt; text-indent: 0.5in">NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the
foregoing and the mutual promises contained herein, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the Corporation
and the Indemnitee hereby agree as follows:</P>
