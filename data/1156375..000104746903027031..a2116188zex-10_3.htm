CBOT, which shall trigger CME's rights under Section&nbsp;10.1. For purposes of this Section&nbsp;10.9, a failure by CBOT's electronic trade matching facility service provider that was within such

DESCRIPTION OF CLEARING AND SETTLEMENT SERVICES  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In accordance with the terms of this Agreement, CME shall provide clearing services as follows with respect to transactions in CBOT Products: </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><I>Electronic Trade Acceptance.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CME shall accept for clearing and guarantee matched trades submitted to CME by CBOT (or CBOT's electronic
trade matching facility service provider) in accordance with the CME Rules and the Operational Policies and Procedures in effect from time to time. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><I>Pit Trade Acceptance&#151;Electronic Devices.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CME shall receive unmatched trade records submitted to CME by CBOT from electronic pit
trading technology devices, and CME shall accept for clearing and guarantee such trades upon matching by CME in accordance with the CME Rules and the Operational Policies and Procedures in effect from
time to time. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><I>Pit Trade Acceptance&#151;Open Outcry.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CME shall receive unmatched trade records submitted to CME by Special CME Clearing Members
for trades executed without benefit of electronic pit trading technology devices, and CME shall accept for clearing and guarantee such trades upon matching by CME in accordance with the CME Rules and
the Operational Policies and Procedures in effect from time to time. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><I>Ex-Pit Trade Acceptance.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CME shall receive unmatched trade records submitted to CME by Special CME Clearing Members for
ex-pit trades (blocks and EFPs) that are executed in accordance with CBOT rules, and CME shall accept for clearing and guarantee such trades upon payment of initial settlement variation
and performance bond by the applicable settlement bank for each party to the transaction, as set forth in the CME Rules and the Operational Policies and Procedures in effect from time to time. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><I>Requirements for CME Trade Acceptance.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the other requirements that may be set forth in this Agreement, the CME Rules and the
Operational Policies and Procedures, the following requirements apply to CME's receipt and acceptance for clearing of trades as set forth in this Schedule&nbsp;A: </FONT></P>

<UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><I>Origins for Matched and Unmatched Trade Records.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CME will support up to four origins for transactions in CBOT Products&#151;house,
house market-maker, customer, and customer market-maker&#151;subject to final confirmation by CBOT promptly following the effective date. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><I>Report Formats.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Message formats for trade records, including but not limited to, trade registers, out-trade and EQC reports,
and brokers' matched and unmatched trade reports shall conform to CME specifications. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><I>Opposite House Switches.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CME will not support the current modified contra matching practice currently employed by BOTCC with respect to
unmatched trades in CBOT products. However, CME will facilitate matching of unmatched trades by performing automatic opposite house switches for unmatched trades in CBOT products, as CME does for
unmatched trades in its own products, in accordance with the CME Rules and the Operational Policies and Procedures. CME will explore the functional requirements for integrating modified
contra-matching processes as a possible enhancement after the Launch Date. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><I>SLEDs.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CME will not support single-line spread entry functionality ("SLEDs") as of the Launch Date. CME will use reasonable
efforts, in consultation with CBOT, to implement SLEDs for transactions in CBOT products by February&nbsp;20, 2004. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><I>Position Maintenance and Settlement.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a daily basis CME shall calculate and collect original margin, premium and variation margin on
futures and options trades and positions in the accounts of Special CME Clearing Members. CME shall settle the gains and losses associated with futures and options trades and positions in the accounts
of clearing members at least once each business day, typically twice each business day, and more frequently as CME determines is warranted by market volatility. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><I>CME PCS Process.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CME's position change submission (PCS) process will be used for reporting final positions and spreadable positions and to
determine each clearing member's final position for margining purposes and for exercise and assignment of options, as well as for determining the exchange open interest to be reported for each
business day. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><I>Net Margining of CBOT Products.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CME will support net margining of positions in CBOT Products in substantially the same manner as the
current procedures employed by BOTCC with respect to performance bond requirements. Notwithstanding the foregoing, CME may adjust formulas for calculating security deposit
requirements or assessment of security deposit contributions with respect to net-margined products, as CME in its reasonable discretion deems appropriate in order to fairly and equitably
calculate security deposit requirements, given differences between positions subject to gross margining and positions subject to net margining. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><I>SPAN Files.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CME will generate and distribute to Special CME Clearing Members' and customers' SPAN files reflecting SPAN margining of
positions in CBOT Products. SPAN files will be distributed over the internet and through any other means specified in the CME Rules and the Operational Policies and Procedures. CME may generate and
distribute joint SPAN files for positions in CBOT Products, CME products and products of any other exchange for which CME provides clearing services or linked clearing. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><I>Authority Over Clearing Firm Margin Requirements.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CME will work with CBOT to develop a coordinated performance bond / margin review process
such that CME can receive input from CBOT as to performance bond / margin requirements. Such process shall involve monthly meetings with representatives designated by CBOT and will involve data
analysis and discussions with respect to how and when to implement changes to clearing firm level performance bond / margin requirements; provided however, that ultimate control over performance bond
/ margin requirements at the clearing member level shall reside with CME. Notwithstanding the foregoing, CME agrees that determinations by CME with respect to performance bond / margin requirements
for CBOT Core Products shall be made strictly on the basis of risk management principles and shall not involve competitive considerations associated with CME products and competing CBOT Products.
Additionally, CME shall not recognize clearing member level spreads between CBOT Products and products of any other exchange without the prior written approval of CBOT. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><I>Authority Over Customer Level Requirements.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CBOT shall have ultimate control over customer level exchange minimum performance bond / margin
and spread requirements, provided that CBOT shall consult with CME as to such requirements as a part of the coordinated review process to be developed between CME and CBOT. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><I>Acceptable Collateral.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CME will review the forms of collateral currently accepted by BOTCC that are not currently accepted by CME and,
where in CME's judgment such additional forms of collateral are frequently used and not unduly costly or risky to accept, CME will amend the CME Rules to accept such forms of collateral with respect
to CBOT Products. Notwithstanding the foregoing, CME will conduct this review process prior to the Launch Date only if time permits. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><I>Transfers.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CME shall effect the transfer of positions in CBOT Products between Special CME Clearing Members, where applicable, in

deliverable positions, inventory of deliverable supply, delivery intent processing, delivery assignment, and delivery invoicing, except that CBOT shall maintain responsibility for management and
operation of the registration and delivery process. CME will provide automated deliveries support as of the Launch Date of financial and equity CBOT Products that are listed for trading by CBOT as of
the Effective Date. CME will use its best efforts to implement automated deliveries support of other CBOT Products that are listed for trading by CBOT as of the Effective Date, including agricultural
products, as of the Launch Date or as soon thereafter as is practicable. CME shall provide automated deliveries support for new CBOT Products (or for changed features of existing CBOT Products) listed
for trading by CBOT after the Effective Date, provided that the product characteristics permit automation of deliveries management through means substantially similar to those that CME then employs
with respect to other products cleared by CME. If significant development work will be required by CME to provide automated deliveries support for such products listed for trading by CBOT after the
Effective Date, the work will be subject to the change request procedures set forth in Section&nbsp;3.10. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><I>Settlement Banks.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CME will interface with all banks that serve as settlement banks for transactions in CME products to provide settlement
services for transactions in CBOT Products also, provided that such banks agree to serve as settlement banks for transactions in CBOT Products. Additionally, CME will use best efforts to establish a
settlement bank relationship with Lakeside Bank and, as appropriate, Burling Bank, prior to the Launch Date. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><I>Large Trader Reports.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CME will collect on CBOT's behalf the large trader submissions from Special CME Clearing Members or their clients and
forward such submissions to the CFTC and to CBOT for regulatory purposes. The CME clearing house shall be authorized to use this data to perform the type of account level stress testing it performs on
its own products to identify concentration of client exposure at a clearing member. CME shall facilitate reporting of large trader data for CBOT products by accepting transmissions of such data in
standard formats. CME shall construct an application that maintains a database of firms, customer accounts, and EINs (the term CBOT uses for the number used to aggregate customer accounts by
beneficial owner). For each reported position, the application shall search in the database by the firm and customer account: a)&nbsp;if the firm and customer account is found, the application shall
tag the position with the EIN for it; and b)&nbsp;if the firm and customer account is not found, the application shall assign the EIN, using CBOT's standard convention, and tag the position with the
newly-assigned EIN. The application shall then prepare a datafile of reported positions for transmission to CBOT, with each position tagged with its EIN.
The application shall further provide CBOT staff with an interface for viewing and modifying the EIN assigned to a particular firm and customer account. CBOT shall provide an initial datafile or files
for loading this application with its existing EINs and their associated firm and customer accounts. CME shall prepare position limit reports against the large trader data for provision to CBOT. Other
than these enumerated processes, all </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>responsibility
for large trader reporting analysis and other larger trader-related functions remains with CBOT. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><I>Calculation and Collection of Fees.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CME will calculate, bill and collect clearing fees from Special CME Clearing Members for transactions
in CBOT Products, using the transaction types for which CME currently bills clearing members with respect to transactions in its own products. The rate billed will be determined by CBOT for the fee
for initial cleared transactions, including block trades, EFPs and other alternative execution procedures, and by CME for post-trade transaction types (including, without limitation,
give-ups, transfers, option exercise and assignment, and deliveries). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><I>Operational Timeline.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Except as otherwise set forth in the CME Rules or the Operational Policies and Procedures, the operational timeline
for clearing services and submission of reports for transactions and positions in CBOT Products shall be the same as it is with respect to transactions and positions for CME products. CME anticipates
using single, combined clearing process cycles for both CME products and CBOT Products. Consequently, CME's deadlines and requirements shall apply with respect to processes including, but not limited
to, trade report submission deadlines, out-trade report production, final reconciliation and option exercise deadlines, mark-to-market and settlement cycles
(including intra-day cycles), collateral substitution and withdrawal deadlines, and pay/collect procedures. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><I>Support for Existing and Future CBOT Product Characteristics.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subject to any specific limitations set forth in this Schedule&nbsp;A or
elsewhere in this Agreement, in providing the Clearing Services CME will develop systems and adopt practices as necessary to support the product features and characteristics of CBOT products as they
are listed for trading as of the Effective Date, including, without limitation, fractional price formats and variable cabinet pricing. CME shall similarly support new product features and
characteristics of existing CBOT Products or those that CBOT may list for trading in the future, provided, however, that if the features and characteristics of such products differ materially from
those of products then cleared by CME, CME's support of such new product features or characteristics shall be subject to the change request procedures set forth in Section&nbsp;3.10. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><I>Security Deposit Management and Assessment.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CME will calculate and collect from Special CME Clearing Members security deposit contributions
in accordance with the CME Rules and the Operational Policies and
Procedures in effect from time to time. CME shall have the authority, as set forth in the CME Rules and the Operational Policies and Procedures in effect from time to time, to seize the security
deposits of Special CME Clearing Members and to further exercise certain limited assessment powers in the event of a default by either a Special CME Clearing Member or a CME clearing member. For the
avoidance of doubt, CME shall manage a joint security deposit pool for the benefit of Special CME Clearing Members and CME clearing members with respect to transactions in CME products, transactions
in CBOT Products, and transactions in the products of any other exchange for which CME provides clearing services or linked clearing, unless CME's agreement with such other exchange prohibits a joint
guarantee fund. Consequently, the security deposit contributions of CME-only clearing members may be assessed as a result of defaults as to transactions in CBOT Products, and the
contributions of CBOT-only clearing members who are Special CME Clearing Members may be assessed as a result of defaults as to transactions in CME products. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><I>Support for Cross-Margining of CBOT Products.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CME will provide support for and will participate in cross-margining of positions in CBOT
Products held by Special CME Clearing Members pursuant to CBOT's existing cross-margining arrangements with GSCC and OCC, provided that CBOT shall secure any necessary amendments to substitute CME for
BOTCC in its current cross-margining agreements with GSCC and OCC. CME will provide support for and will participate in cross-margining of positions in CBOT Products held by Special CME Clearing
Members under any other cross-margining agreements (or amendments to existing agreements) into which CBOT may enter in the future, provided that (i)&nbsp;such support, including without limitation
the development of necessary interfaces, shall be subject to the change request procedures set forth in Section&nbsp;3.10, and (ii)&nbsp;CME may decline </FONT></P>

throughout the development period prior to the Launch Date, the Parties will use their best efforts to update the project development plan (the "Plan", as updated from time to time during the
development period). The Plan shall identify, with reasonable detail, (i)&nbsp;all material information that must be exchanged between the Parties, (ii)&nbsp;any outstanding matters that must be
agreed to between the Parties or decisions that must be reached by one Party, (iii)&nbsp;all material tasks that must be completed by either Party, and (iv)&nbsp;the timeline upon which such tasks
must be completed in order to meet the Launch Date. The Parties shall also use their best efforts to jointly develop and incorporate within the Plan an (i)&nbsp;outline and timeline for completing
legal documentation, including necessary regulatory filings and any documentation that must be executed by Special CME Clearing Members or other entities, and (ii)&nbsp;and outline and timeline for
other communications with Special CME Clearing Members, ISVs, market data vendors, back-office service bureaus and any other entity with which information must be shared in order to
effectuate a successful launch of Clearing Services. </FONT></P>

participate fully in the planning process and to complete its required tasks in accordance with the timeline identified in the Plan. CME understands and agrees that it has primary responsibility for
completing the development work necessary to implement Clearing Services as described in Schedule&nbsp;A. CBOT understands and agrees that it also will have development work to complete in order to
effectively implement Clearing Services, including without limitation any development work necessary to
provide to CME the information and reports specified to be provided by CBOT in Schedule&nbsp;A. Both Parties understand and agree that their full participation will be required for multiple phases

Party shall not be deemed a Material Breach of this Agreement. However, if either Party concludes that a serious failure or multiple failures to conform to the tasks and timelines set forth in the
Plan jeopardizes the Parties' ability to meet the Launch Date, the concerned Party shall so notify the relevant management personnel of the other Party (including the individuals identified in
Section&nbsp;19.5) in writing, which may be by e-mail, and the Parties shall use reasonable efforts to resolve the matter and adjust the Plan to the concerned Party's satisfaction. If
such efforts are not successful, the concerned Party may, not sooner than ten (10)&nbsp;business days after delivering the notice, submit the matter to arbitration. If the arbitrator concludes that
one of the Parties is primarily and substantially at fault for the failure and that the failure does jeopardize the Launch Date, the other Party shall have the option to terminate this Agreement for
