of such termination and at all times theretofore, and (B)&nbsp;the Executive&#146;s employment with the Company is terminated by the Company without Cause or by the Executive for Good Reason on or after the date that is eighteen (18)&nbsp;months
following the date of such Significant Corporate Event, then the applicable vesting provisions shall apply as if a Change in Control had occurred immediately prior to such termination of employment (and, for the avoidance of doubt, if affirmative
consent of the Sponsor Shareholders or a representative thereof is required to terminate the Executive&#146;s employment and the Executive&#146;s employment is terminated for any reason within the 18 month period commencing on the date of a
Significant Corporate Event, then no Change in Control vesting provisions shall apply). </FONT></P>
