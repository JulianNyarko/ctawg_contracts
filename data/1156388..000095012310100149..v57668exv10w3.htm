<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 12pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, reference is made to that certain Credit Agreement, dated as of October&nbsp;18, 2010 (as
amended, modified, supplemented or restated hereafter, the &#147;<U>Credit Agreement</U>&#148;), by and
among, among others, (i)&nbsp;Big 5 Corp. (the &#147;<U>Lead Borrower</U>&#148;), (ii)&nbsp;the other Borrowers party
thereto, (iii)&nbsp;the Administrative Agent, (iv)&nbsp;the Collateral Agent, and (v)&nbsp;the Lenders party
thereto (the &#147;<U>Lenders</U>&#148;). Capitalized terms used herein and not defined herein shall have
the meanings assigned to such terms in the Credit Agreement.
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 12pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, the Lenders have agreed to make Loans to the Borrowers, and the L/C Issuer has agreed
to issue Letters of Credit for the account of the Borrowers, pursuant to, and upon the terms and
subject to the conditions specified in, the Credit Agreement.
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 12pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, the Guarantor is the owner of 100% of the Equity Interests in the Lead Borrower, and
acknowledges that it will receive direct and indirect benefits from the availability of the credit
facility provided for in the Credit Agreement, from the making of the Loans by the Lenders, and the
issuance of the Letters of Credit by the L/C Issuer.
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 12pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, the obligations of the Lenders to make Loans and of the L/C Issuer to issue Letters
of Credit are each conditioned upon, among other things, the execution and delivery by the
Guarantor of a guaranty in the form hereof. As consideration therefor, and in order to induce the
Lenders to make Loans and the L/C Issuer to issue Letters of Credit, the Guarantor is willing to
execute this Guaranty.
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 12pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly, the Guarantor hereby agrees as follows:
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 12pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SECTION 1. <U>Guaranty</U>. The Guarantor irrevocably and unconditionally guaranties, as a
primary obligor and not merely as a surety, the due and punctual payment when due (whether at the
stated maturity, by required prepayment, by acceleration or otherwise) and performance by the
Borrowers of all Obligations (collectively, the &#147;<U>Guaranteed Obligations</U>&#148;), including all
such Guaranteed Obligations which shall become due but for the operation of the Bankruptcy Code.
The Guarantor further agrees that the Guaranteed Obligations may be extended or renewed, in whole
or in part, without notice to or further assent from it, and that it will remain bound upon this
Guaranty notwithstanding any extension or renewal of any Guaranteed Obligation.
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 12pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SECTION 2. <U>Guaranteed Obligations Not Affected</U>. To the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law, the Guarantor waives presentment to, demand of payment from, and protest to, any
Loan Party of any of the Guaranteed Obligations, and also waives notice of acceptance of this
Guaranty, notice of protest for nonpayment and all other notices of any kind. To the fullest

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 12pt; margin-top: 6pt">extent permitted by applicable Law, the obligations of the Guarantor hereunder shall not be
affected by (a)&nbsp;the failure of any Agent or any other Credit Party to assert any claim or
demand or to enforce or exercise any right or remedy against any Loan Party under the provisions of
the Credit Agreement, any other Loan Document or otherwise or against any other party with respect
to any of the Guaranteed Obligations, (b)&nbsp;any rescission, waiver, amendment or modification of, or
any release from, any of the terms or provisions of this Guaranty, any other Loan Document or any
other agreement, with respect to any Loan Party or with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations,
(c)&nbsp;the failure to perfect any security interest in, or the release of, any of the Collateral held
by or on behalf of the Collateral Agent or any other Credit Party, or (d)&nbsp;the lack of legal
existence of any Loan Party or legal obligation to discharge any of the Guaranteed Obligations by
any Loan Party for any reason whatsoever, including, without limitation, in any insolvency,
bankruptcy or reorganization of any Loan Party.
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 12pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SECTION 3. <U>Security</U>. The Guarantor hereby acknowledges and agrees that the Collateral
Agent and each of the other Credit Parties may (a)&nbsp;take and hold security for the payment of this
Guaranty and the Guaranteed Obligations and exchange, enforce, waive and release any such security,
(b)&nbsp;apply such security and direct the order or manner of sale thereof as they in their sole
discretion may determine, and (c)&nbsp;release or substitute any one or more endorsees, the Borrowers,
other guarantors or other obligors, in each case without affecting or impairing in any way the
liability of the Guarantor hereunder.
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 12pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SECTION 4. <U>Guaranty of Payment</U>. The Guarantor further agrees that this Guaranty
constitutes a guaranty of payment and performance when due of all Guaranteed Obligations and not of
collection and, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, waives any right to require that
any resort be had by the Collateral Agent or any other Credit Party to any of the Collateral or
other security held for payment of the Guaranteed Obligations or to any balance of any deposit
account or credit on the books of any Agent or any other Credit Party in favor of any Loan Party or
any other Person or to any other guarantor of all or part of the Guaranteed Obligations. Any
payment required to be made by the Guarantor hereunder may be required by any Agent or any other
Credit Party on any number of occasions and shall be payable to the Administrative Agent, for the
benefit of the Agents and the other Credit Parties, in the manner provided in the Credit Agreement.
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 12pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SECTION 5. <U>Indemnification</U>. Without limiting any of its indemnification obligations
under the Credit Agreement or the other Loan Documents, and without duplication of any
indemnification provided for under the Credit Agreement or the other Loan Documents, the Guarantor
shall indemnify the Credit Parties and each of their Subsidiaries and Affiliates, and each of their
respective stockholders, directors, officers, employees, agents, attorneys, and advisors (each such
Person being called an &#147;<U>Indemnitee</U>&#148;), against, and hold each Indemnitee harmless from, any
and all damages, actual out-of-pocket losses, claims, actions, causes of action, settlement
payments, obligations, liabilities and related expenses, including the reasonable fees, charges and
disbursements of any counsel for any Indemnitee, incurred, suffered, sustained or required to be
paid by, or asserted against, any Indemnitee arising out of, in any way connected with, or as a
result of, (i)&nbsp;the execution or delivery of this Guaranty, the Credit Agreement or any other Loan
Document or any other agreement or instrument contemplated hereby, the performance by the Guarantor
of its obligations thereunder, or the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Credit

arising from any of the foregoing, whether based on contract, tort or any other theory and
regardless of whether any
Indemnitee is a party thereto; <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, such indemnity shall not, as
to any Indemnitee, be available to the extent that such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or
related expenses (x)&nbsp;are determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable
judgment to have resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee or
(y)&nbsp;result from a claim brought by a Borrower or any other Loan Party against an Indemnitee for
intentional breach of such Indemnitee&#146;s obligations hereunder or under any other Loan Document, if
the Borrowers or such Loan Party has obtained a final and nonappealable judgment in its favor on
such claim as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction.
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 12pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SECTION 6. <U>No Discharge or Diminishment of Guaranty</U>. The obligations of the Guarantor
hereunder shall not be subject to any reduction, limitation, impairment or termination for any
reason (other than the indefeasible payment in full in cash of the Guaranteed Obligations),
including any claim of waiver, release, surrender, alteration or compromise of any of the
Guaranteed Obligations, and shall not be subject to any defense or set-off, counterclaim,
recoupment or termination whatsoever by reason of the invalidity, illegality or unenforceability of
the Guaranteed Obligations or otherwise. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
Guaranteed Obligations of the Guarantor hereunder shall not be discharged or impaired or otherwise
affected by the failure of any Agent or any other Credit Party to assert any claim or demand or to
enforce any remedy under this Guaranty, the Credit Agreement, any other Loan Document or any other
agreement, by any waiver or modification of any provision of any thereof, by any default, failure
or delay, willful or otherwise, in the performance of the Guaranteed Obligations, or by any other
act or omission that may or might in any manner or to any extent vary the risk of the Guarantor or
that would otherwise operate as a discharge of the Guarantor as a matter of law or equity (other
than the indefeasible payment in full in cash of the Guaranteed Obligations).
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 12pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SECTION 7. <U>Defenses of Loan Parties Waived</U>. To the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law, the Guarantor waives any defense based on or arising out of any defense of any Loan
Party or the unenforceability of the Guaranteed Obligations or any part thereof from any cause, or
the cessation from any cause of the liability of any Loan Party, other than the indefeasible
payment in full in cash of the Guaranteed Obligations. The Guarantor hereby acknowledges that the
Agents and the other Credit Parties may, at their election, foreclose on any security held by one
or more of them by one or more judicial or nonjudicial sales, accept an assignment of any such
security in lieu of foreclosure, compromise or adjust any part of the Guaranteed Obligations, make
any other accommodation with any Loan Party, or exercise any other right or remedy available to
them against any Loan Party, without affecting or impairing in any way the liability of the
Guarantor hereunder except to the extent that the Guaranteed Obligations have been indefeasibly
paid in full in cash. Pursuant to, and to the extent permitted by, applicable Law, the Guarantor
waives any defense arising out of any such election and waives any benefit of and right to
participate in any such foreclosure action, even though such election operates, pursuant to
applicable Law, to impair or to extinguish any right of reimbursement or subrogation or other right
or remedy of the Guarantor against any Loan Party, as the case may be, or any security. The
Guarantor agrees that it shall not assert any claim in competition with any Agent or any other
Credit Party in respect of any payment made hereunder in any bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, or any other proceeding.

in limitation of any other right that the Agents or any other Credit Party has at law or in equity
against the Guarantor by virtue hereof, upon the failure of any Loan Party to pay any Guaranteed
Obligation when and as the same shall become due, whether at maturity, by acceleration, after
notice of prepayment or otherwise, the Guarantor hereby promises to and will forthwith pay, or
cause to be paid, to the Agents or such other Credit Party as designated thereby in cash the amount
of such unpaid Guaranteed Obligations. Upon payment by the Guarantor of any sums to any Agent or
any other Credit Party as provided above, all rights of the Guarantor against any Loan Party
arising as a result thereof by way of right of subrogation, contribution, reimbursement, indemnity
or otherwise shall in all respects be subordinate and junior in right of payment to the prior
indefeasible payment in full in cash of all the Guaranteed Obligations. In addition, any
indebtedness of the Borrowers or any other Loan Party now or hereafter held by the Guarantor is
hereby subordinated in right of payment to the prior indefeasible payment in full in cash of all of
the Guaranteed Obligations. Notwithstanding the foregoing, unless an Event of Default has occurred
and is continuing, the Borrowers or any other Loan Party may make payments to the Guarantor on
account of any such indebtedness. After the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of
Default, the Guarantor will not demand, sue for, or otherwise attempt to collect any such
indebtedness until the indefeasible payment in full in cash of the Guaranteed Obligations,
termination or expiration of the Commitments, and termination of the L/C Issuer&#146;s obligation to
issue Letters of Credit under the Credit Agreement. If any amount shall erroneously be paid to the
Guarantor on account of (a)&nbsp;such subrogation, contribution, reimbursement, indemnity or similar
right or (b)&nbsp;any such indebtedness of any Loan Party, such amount shall be held in trust for the
benefit of the Credit Parties and shall forthwith be paid to the Administrative Agent to be
credited against the payment of the Guaranteed Obligations, whether matured or unmatured, in
accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement.

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 12pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SECTION 9. <U>Limitation on Guaranty of Guaranteed Obligations</U>. In any action or
proceeding with respect to the Guarantor involving any state corporate law, the Bankruptcy Code or
any other state or federal bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other law affecting the rights
of creditors generally, if the obligations of the Guarantor under SECTION 1 hereof would otherwise
be held or determined to be void, invalid or unenforceable, or subordinated to the claims of any
other creditors, on account of the amount of its liability under said SECTION 1, then,
notwithstanding any other provision hereof to the contrary, the amount of such liability shall,
without any further action by the Guarantor, any Credit Party, any Agent or any other Person, be
automatically limited and reduced to the highest amount which is valid and enforceable and not
subordinated to the claims of other creditors as determined in such action or proceeding.

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 12pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SECTION 10. <U>Information.</U> The Guarantor assumes all responsibility for being and
keeping itself informed of each Loan Party&#146;s financial condition and assets, and of all other
circumstances bearing upon the risk of nonpayment of the Guaranteed Obligations and the nature,
scope and extent of the risks that the Guarantor assumes and incurs hereunder, and agrees that none
of the Agents or the other Credit Parties will have any duty to advise the Guarantor of information
known to it or any of them regarding such circumstances or risks.

Party or the Guarantor upon the bankruptcy or reorganization of any Loan Party or otherwise.

cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies which they would otherwise have. No
delay or omission by the Agents in exercising or enforcing any of the Agents&#146; Rights and
Remedies shall operate as, or constitute, a waiver thereof. No waiver by the Agents of any
Event of Default or of any default under any other agreement shall operate as a waiver of
any other default hereunder or under any other agreement. No single or partial exercise of
any of the Agents&#146; Rights or Remedies, and no express or implied agreement or transaction of
whatever nature entered into between the Agents and any Person, at any time, shall preclude
the other or further exercise of the Agents&#146; Rights and Remedies. No waiver by the Agents
of any of the Agents&#146; Rights and Remedies on any one occasion shall be deemed a waiver on
any subsequent occasion, nor shall it be deemed a continuing waiver. The Agents&#146; Rights and
Remedies may be exercised at such time or times and in such order of preference as the
Agents may determine. The Agents&#146; Rights and Remedies may be exercised without resort or
regard to any other source of satisfaction of the Guaranteed Obligations. No waiver of any
provisions of this Guaranty or any other Loan Document or consent to any departure by the
Guarantor therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be permitted by
