STOCK PLAN </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="center"><B>Amended and Restated Effective May&nbsp;21, 2014 </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>1. </B><B><I>Purpose. </I></B>The purpose of the CME Group Inc. Director Stock Plan (the &#147;Plan&#148;) is to provide CME Group Inc. (the
&#147;Company&#148;) with an effective means of attracting, retaining, and motivating non-employee directors of the Company and to further align their interests with those of the Company&#146;s shareholders by providing for or increasing their stock
ownership interests in the Company. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>2.</B><B><I> Eligibility. </I></B>Any director of the Company who is not an employee of the Company
(&#147;Eligible Director&#148;) is eligible to participate in the Plan. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>3.</B><B><I> Administration.</I></B> The Plan shall be administered by a
Committee (the &#147;Committee&#148;) of the Board of Directors of the Company (the &#147;Board&#148;) comprised solely of independent directors. Initially, the Committee responsible for the administration of the Plan shall be the Compensation
Committee. Except as otherwise expressly provided in the Plan, the Committee shall have full power and authority to interpret and administer the Plan, to determine the Eligible Directors to receive awards and the amounts, types and terms of the
awards, to adopt, amend, and rescind rules and regulations, and to establish terms and conditions, not inconsistent with the provisions of the Plan, for the administration and implementation of the Plan, provided, however, that the Committee may not
(subject to Section&nbsp;8 hereof), after the date of any award, make any changes that would adversely affect the rights of a recipient under such award without the consent of the recipient. The determination of the Committee on all matters shall be
final and conclusive and binding on the Company and all Eligible Directors and other interested parties. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>4. </B><B><I>Awards.</I></B> Awards may be
made by the Committee in such amounts as it shall determine in cash, in unrestricted shares of Class&nbsp;A common stock of the Company (&#147;Common Stock&#148;), in options to purchase shares of Common Stock of the Company (&#147;Options&#148;) or
in shares of Common Stock subject to certain restrictions (&#147;Restricted Stock&#148;) or any combination thereof. There shall be 625,000 shares of Common Stock available for issuance in connection with awards under the Plan, subject to adjustment
as provided in Section&nbsp;8. To the extent shares subject to an outstanding award are not issued or delivered by reason of the expiration, termination, or cancellation or forfeiture or by reason of the delivery or withholding of shares to pay all
or a portion of the exercise price of an award, if any, or to satisfy all or a portion of the tax withholding obligations relating to an award, then the corresponding number of shares which were reserved for issuance in connection therewith shall
again be available for the purposes of the Plan. Shares available under the Plan may be authorized and unissued shares or may be treasury shares or a combination thereof. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>5.</B><B><I> Restricted Stock Grants.</I></B> Awards of Restricted Stock may be granted by the Committee to Eligible Directors subject to such restrictions
on transfer and forfeiture conditions as the Committee may deem appropriate. Shares subject to a grant of Restricted Stock may not be sold, transferred, pledged, assigned, or otherwise alienated or hypothecated during the applicable period of
restriction. Each grant of Restricted Stock shall be evidenced by a Restricted Stock agreement that shall specify the number of shares granted, the period of restriction applicable to the grant of Restricted Stock and such other terms and conditions
as the Committee, in its sole discretion, shall determine. The period of restriction applicable to each grant of Restricted Stock which vests based upon continued service shall be at least one (1)&nbsp;year (subject to the change of control
provisions set forth in Section&nbsp;8). Unless the Committee determines otherwise, shares of Restricted Stock shall be held by the Company as escrow agent during the applicable period of restriction, together with stock powers or other

instruments of assignment (including a power of attorney), each endorsed in blank with a guarantee of signature if deemed necessary or appropriate by the Committee, which would permit transfer to
the Company of all or a portion of the Restricted Stock in the event such Restricted Stock is forfeited in whole or in part. The Committee may, in its discretion, legend the certificates representing Restricted Stock during the applicable period of
restriction to give appropriate notice of such restrictions. For example, the Committee may determine that some or all certificates representing shares of Restricted Stock shall bear the following legend: </P>

certain restrictions on transfer as set forth in the CME Group Inc. Director Stock Plan (the &#147;Plan&#148;), and in a restricted stock agreement. A copy of the Plan and such restricted stock agreement may be obtained from the Secretary of CME
Group Inc.&#148; </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">During any applicable period of restriction, Eligible Directors holding Restricted Stock may exercise full voting rights with respect to

of the Plan means the closing transaction price of the Common Stock on the NASDAQ Global Select Market or other applicable exchange upon which the Common Stock is traded on the date as of which such value is being determined. </P>

reason other than by death, permanent disability (as determined by the Board) or expiration of his or her term of service as a director, any unvested portion of an award granted hereunder shall immediately terminate and be forfeited to the Company
without consideration. Upon a termination of service due to death, permanent disability or expiration of term of service as a director, all unvested awards granted hereunder shall immediately become fully vested. </P>

dividend, extraordinary cash dividend, split-up, share combination, or other similar change in the corporate structure of the Company affecting the Common Stock, the Committee shall adjust the number, class and series of securities available under
the Plan, the number, class, series and purchase price of securities subject to outstanding awards under the Plan and the numerical limit set forth in Section&nbsp;4 in such manner as the Committee in its sole discretion shall determine to be
appropriate to prevent the dilution or diminution of outstanding awards under the Plan. Notwithstanding anything in this Plan to the contrary, all awards outstanding hereunder shall become fully vested upon the occurrence of a change of control.

other action as may be necessary or appropriate to satisfy any such withholding obligations. The Committee may determine the manner in which such tax withholding may be satisfied, and may permit shares of Common Stock to be used to satisfy required
tax withholding based on the fair market value of any such shares of Common Stock, as of the appropriate time of each award. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>10.</B><B><I> Expenses.
