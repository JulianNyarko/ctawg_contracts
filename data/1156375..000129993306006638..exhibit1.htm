in accordance with their respective shares of such Advance by giving notice of such prepayment by
10:00&nbsp;a.m. (Chicago time) on the date of such payment to Administrative Agent. Administrative
Agent shall promptly provide a copy of such notice to each Bank. Repayment of principal pursuant
to this <U>Section&nbsp;2.5</U> shall be applied to prepay the outstanding Loans, pro rata, and shall
be accompanied by accrued and unpaid interest thereon.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">Section&nbsp;2.6 <U>Mandatory Principal Payments</U>. On any day on which the aggregate
outstanding principal of the Loans exceeds the Borrowing Base or the Aggregate Commitment, such

<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">Section&nbsp;2.7.1 <U>Adjustments by the Company</U>. The Company may permanently reduce the
Aggregate Commitment, in whole or in part ratably among the Banks, in proportion to the amounts of
their respective Commitments in integral multiples of $1,000,000, upon at least ten Business Days&#146;
written notice to Administrative Agent, which shall promptly provide a copy of such notice to each
Bank. Such notice shall specify the amount of any such reduction; <U>provided</U>,
<U>however</U>, that, subject to <U>Sections&nbsp;2.7.2</U>, <U>11.9(b)</U> and <U>11.9(c)</U>, the
amount of the Aggregate Commitment may not be reduced below the outstanding principal amount of the
Advance(s), and <U>provided</U> further that a reduction by the Company of the Aggregate
Commitment to zero shall terminate this Agreement as of the effective date of such reduction. All
accrued and unpaid commitment fees shall be payable on the effective date of such termination.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">Section&nbsp;2.7.2 <U>Adjustments by Banks for Accelerated Termination</U>. If the Commitment of
a Bank hereunder is terminated pursuant to <U>Section&nbsp;11.9(b)</U> or <U>11.9(c)</U>, the Company
shall immediately notify Administrative Agent in writing of such termination (<B>&#147;Accelerated
Termination Notice&#148;</B>) and shall state the amount of such terminating Bank&#146;s Commitment (<B>&#147;Terminated
Commitment&#148;</B>) in the Accelerated Termination Notice. Administrative Agent shall promptly provide a
copy of the Accelerated Termination Notice to each remaining Bank (each a <B>&#147;Non-Terminating Bank&#148;</B>).
Each Non-Terminating Bank shall notify the Company, in writing, on or before the fifth Business Day

increase its Commitment, which amount shall be equal to all or some portion of the Terminated
Commitment (each, a <B>&#147;2.7.2 Notice&#148;</B>). Any Non-Terminating Bank that fails to so notify the Company
on or before such fifth Business Day, shall be deemed to have declined to increase its Commitment.
If offers to increase Commitments are made by two or more Non-Terminating Banks in an aggregate
amount greater than the aggregate amount of the Terminated Commitment, such Non-Terminating Banks
and the Company hereby agree that such offers shall be allocated as nearly as possible in
proportion to the aggregate amount of such offers, so that the aggregate amount thereof will not
exceed the amount of the Terminated Commitment. On or before the 6th Business Day after the date
of the Accelerated Termination Notice, the Company shall notify Administrative Agent and each
Non-Terminating Bank of the amount by which each such Non-Terminating Bank&#146;s Commitment has been
increased, which amount shall not exceed the amount of such Non-Terminating Bank&#146;s offer to
increase its Commitment in such Bank&#146;s 2.7.2 Notice. All increases of Commitments by the Banks
under this <U>Section&nbsp;2.7.2</U> shall become effective on the terminating Bank&#146;s Accelerated
Termination Date (<B>&#147;2.7.2 Effective Date&#148;</B>). The Company shall promptly, and in no event later than
the 2.7.2 Effective Date, deliver to each Bank whose Commitment has been increased pursuant to this
<U>Section&nbsp;2.7.2</U> a new Note reflecting such Bank&#146;s new Commitment amount and each such Bank
shall promptly, after repayment to such Bank of such Bank&#146;s ratable share of all Advances
outstanding on the 2.7.2 Effective Date, return to the Company such Bank&#146;s superseded Note. On the
2.7.2 Effective Date, the Commitments shall be adjusted to reflect any such increases.

Credit Termination Date, the Company agrees to pay to Administrative Agent for the ratable account
of the Banks a commitment fee of 7/100 of 1% per annum (on the basis of a year consisting of 360
days and for actual days elapsed) on the daily amount of such Bank&#146;s ratable share (determined in
proportion to its respective Commitment) of the excess of (i)&nbsp;the amount of the Aggregate
Commitment over (ii)&nbsp;the aggregate principal amount of all outstanding Advances of the Banks,
payable in arrears on the last day of each November, February, May and August hereafter and on the
Revolving Credit Termination Date, commencing on the first of such dates to occur after the date
hereof.

least three (3)&nbsp;Business Days&#146; prior written notice to Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent,
which notice shall specify the amount of any such increase and shall be delivered at a time when no
Default or Unmatured Default has occurred and is continuing. The Company may, after giving such
notice and in its sole discretion, offer the increase in the Aggregate Commitment to other lenders
or entities reasonably acceptable to Administrative Agent and the Company. No increase in the
Aggregate Commitment shall become effective until the existing or new Banks extending such new or
increased Commitment amount and the Company shall have delivered to Administrative Agent a document
reasonably satisfactory to Administrative Agent and the Company pursuant to which any such existing
Bank states the amount of its Commitment increase, any such new Bank states its Commitment amount
and agrees to assume and accept the obligations and rights of a Bank hereunder and the Company
accepts such new or increased Commitments. The Banks (new or existing) shall accept an assignment
from the existing Banks, and the existing Banks shall make an assignment to the new or existing
Banks accepting a new or increased Commitment, of a direct interest in each then outstanding
Advance such that, after giving effect thereto, all credit exposure hereunder is held ratably by
the Banks in proportion to their respective Commitments. Assignments pursuant to the preceding
sentence shall be made in exchange for the principal amount assigned plus accrued and unpaid
interest and accrued and unpaid facility fees. Any such increase of the Aggregate Commitment
shall be subject to receipt by Administrative Agent from the Company of such supplemental opinions,
resolutions, certificates and other documents as Administrative Agent may reasonably request.

any portion of any such Bank&#146;s respective Commitment, with such Bank&#146;s consent, in an amount up to
the amount so reduced, <U>provided</U> that each such Bank shall accept an assignment from the
existing Banks, and the existing Banks shall make an assignment to each such Bank of a direct
interest in each then outstanding Advance such that, after giving effect thereto, all credit
exposure hereunder is held ratably by the Banks in proportion to their respective Commitments. The
documents evidencing any such increase in the Commitment shall be in a form reasonably acceptable
to the Company and Administrative Agent.

satisfaction of the applicable conditions precedent set forth in <U>Article&nbsp;V</U>, each Bank
severally shall make available to Administrative Agent, in the specified account located at
Administrative Agent, its pro rata share of the full amount of each Advance in immediately
available funds. Following the receipt of a notice of Advance from the Company, Collateral Agent
shall determine the aggregate market value of the Collateral and the Borrowing Base in accordance
with the terms hereof and promptly, but in any event, not later than 4:15 p.m. (Chicago time),
provide the Company, Administrative Agent and each Bank with a Collateral Notice. Upon

following order: first, to amounts payable hereunder other than principal, interest and commitment
fees; second, to commitment fees (in chronological order in accordance with the dates such fees
became due and payable); and third, to principal of, and interest on, the Advances (in

ratably among the Banks, in proportion to the amounts of their respective Commitments on the date

from time to time under this Agreement and the Notes; and each Bank is hereby authorized to record
the principal amount of each of its Loans and each repayment on the schedule attached to its Note
or in its books and records; <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that the failure to so record shall
not affect the Company&#146;s obligations under such Note. Administrative Agent shall also maintain

principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable from the Company to each Bank
hereunder and (iii)&nbsp;the amount of any sum received by Administrative Agent hereunder from the
Company and each Bank&#146;s share thereof. The entries maintained in the accounts maintained by the
Banks and Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section shall be <I>prima facie </I>evidence of the

the failure of Administrative Agent or any Bank to maintain such accounts or any error therein
shall not in any manner affect the obligation of the Company to repay the Loans in accordance with

Administrative Agent, the records maintained by Administrative Agent shall control.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(b)&nbsp;The Company hereby authorizes the Banks and Administrative Agent to extend Advances based
on telephonic notices made by any Persons any such Bank or Administrative Agent in good faith
believes to be acting on behalf of the Company. The Company agrees to deliver promptly to
Administrative Agent a written confirmation of each telephonic notice signed by an authorized

accrued on each Advance after maturity shall be payable on demand. Interest and commitment fees
shall be calculated for actual days elapsed on the basis of a 360-day year. Interest shall be
payable for the day an Advance is made but not for the day of any payment on the amount paid if
payment is received prior to noon (local time at the place of payment). If any payment of
principal of, or interest on, an Advance shall become due on a day which is not a Business Day,
such payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day and, in the case of a principal
payment, such extension of time shall be included in computing interest in connection with such
payment.

when such Advance is to be made; and (d)&nbsp;the account located at Administrative Agent to which the
applicable Bank&#146;s ratable share of such Advance shall be sent. Except as hereinafter provided,
promptly after receipt of such notice from Administrative Agent and, in any event, before the time
specified in such notice as the time when such Advance is to be made to the Company, each
applicable Bank shall transfer its ratable share of such Advance to Administrative Agent by Federal
Reserve wire transfer or, in the event of a failure of the Federal Reserve wire transfer system, in
other immediately available funds via the SWIFT system or otherwise.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">Section&nbsp;4.2 <U>Payment by Banks to Administrative Agent</U>.(a) Unless Administrative Agent
shall have been notified by a Bank prior to the date on which such Bank is scheduled to make
payment to Administrative Agent of the proceeds of a Loan (which notice shall be effective upon
receipt) that such Bank does not intend to make such payment, Administrative Agent may assume that
such Bank has made such payment when due and Administrative Agent may in reliance upon such
assumption (but shall not be required to) make available to the Company the proceeds of the Loan to
be made by such Bank and, if any Bank has not in fact made such payment to Administrative Agent,
such Bank shall, on demand, pay to Administrative Agent the amount made available to the Company
attributable to such Bank together with interest thereon in respect of each day during the period
commencing on the date such amount was made available to the Company and ending on (but excluding)
the date such Bank pays such amount to Administrative Agent at a rate per annum equal to: (i)&nbsp;from
the date the related advance was made by Administrative Agent to the date two (2)&nbsp;Business Days
after payment by such Bank is due hereunder, the Federal Funds Target Rate for each such day and
(ii)&nbsp;from the date two (2)&nbsp;Business Days after the date such payment is due from such Bank to the
date such payment is made by such Bank, the Federal Funds Target Rate in effect for each such day
plus 2.4%. If such amount is not received from such Bank by Administrative Agent immediately upon
demand, the Company will, on demand, repay to Administrative Agent the proceeds of the Loan
attributable to such Bank with interest thereon at a rate per annum equal to the interest rate
applicable to the relevant Loan.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(b)&nbsp;The failure of any Bank to make a payment to Administrative Agent of the proceeds of the
Loan to be made by such Bank shall not relieve any other Bank of its obligation hereunder to make
payment to Administrative Agent of the proceeds of a Loan, but no Bank shall be responsible for the
failure of any other Bank to make the payment required to be made by such other Bank.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">Section&nbsp;4.3 <U>Distribution of Payments</U>. Whenever Administrative Agent receives from, or
on behalf of the Company, or any other person or party, a payment of principal, interest or

the applicable Banks are entitled to receive a share, Administrative Agent shall promptly pay to
such Banks, in lawful money of the United States of America and in the kind of funds so received by
Administrative Agent, the amount due each of such Banks as determined pursuant to this Agreement;
<U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that the amount of such distribution shall be adjusted to the
extent that amounts are owed by any Bank to Administrative Agent pursuant to <U>Section&nbsp;4.2</U> or

payment of principal, interest or commitment fees or other amount payable in connection with the
Loans is received from or on behalf of the Company by Administrative Agent before 10:00&nbsp;a.m.
(Chicago time) on any Business Day, Administrative Agent shall use reasonable efforts to wire
transfer the appropriate portion of the same to the applicable Banks that same Business Day, but in
any event shall wire the same to each of such Banks before the end of the next Business Day. In
the event that Administrative Agent receives any such payment from or on behalf of the Company
before 10:00&nbsp;a.m. (Chicago time) on any Business Day and does not transfer to the applicable Banks
the appropriate portion of such payment on that day, the Company shall, promptly upon receipt of
notice from any such Bank, pay directly to such Bank an amount equal to the interest on such
portion, at the Fed Funds Target Rate or, with respect to any payment of principal on a Loan, at
the rate set forth in <U>Section&nbsp;3.3</U>, for the period commencing on the day Administrative
Agent receives such payment up to but not including the following Business Day.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">Section&nbsp;4.4 <U>Rescission of Payments by the Company</U>. If all or part of any payment made
by the Company to Administrative Agent of principal, interest or commitment fees or other amount
payable in connection with the Loans is rescinded or must otherwise be returned for any reason and
if Administrative Agent has paid to any of the Banks such Bank&#146;s ratable share therein, such Bank

after 10:00&nbsp;a.m. Chicago time), an amount equal to such Bank&#146;s ratable interest in the amount that
was rescinded or that must be so returned by Administrative Agent. Administrative Agent shall
promptly return to the Company, or to whomever shall be legally entitled thereto pursuant to an
order of a court of competent jurisdiction, each such amount (or any lesser amount) that is
received from each Bank. Administrative Agent shall have no obligation to the Company for any
amount that Administrative Agent paid to any Bank and that is not repaid by such Bank,
<U>provided</U> that Administrative Agent did in fact provide such Bank with the notice described
above to the effect that such payment was rescinded or must be returned.

Banks (each a <B>&#147;Principal Bank&#148;</B>) may, upon mutual agreement, from time to time request another Bank
to act as an additional agent for the purpose of administering and servicing the Loans of the
Principal Banks. Upon the acceptance of the offer to service by the proposed additional agent
(which shall be in the sole discretion of such proposed administrative agent), such Bank shall be
an additional agent (<B>&#147;Additional Agent&#148;</B>) hereunder and as administrator of the Loans of the
Principal Banks for which it acts (and not as an agent, employee or fiduciary), shall be entitled
to exercise all such powers as are incidental to the powers to receive and collect funds from the
Principal Banks and the Company as provided for in this Agreement, and to take such other actions
with respect to such Loans as are provided hereby or as may be from time to time agreed by such
Additional Agent and the Principal Banks. In acting under this Agreement, Additional Agent agrees
to exercise the same degree of care in administering such Loans as it would use in managing its own
loans; <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that this sentence shall not make Additional Agent a
fiduciary to any Principal Bank. The Principal Banks and the Company hereby agree and acknowledge
that (i)&nbsp;in performing the duties provided for in this Agreement, Additional Agent is acting solely
for the benefit of the Principal Banks and are in no way to be construed to be acting as agent for
the Company; and (ii)&nbsp;the servicing arrangement provided for herein is not intended to constitute,
and shall not be construed to establish, a partnership or joint venture between Additional Agent
and the Principal Banks, or between Additional Agent and the Company.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(b)&nbsp;The Company shall promptly notify Administrative Agent of the appointment of an Additional

Persons and upon advice and statements of legal counsel (including, without limitation, counsel to
the Company), independent accountants and other experts selected by such Agent and acceptable to
the Required Banks. Each Agent shall in all cases be fully justified in failing or refusing to
take any action under this Agreement or any other Loan Document unless it shall first receive
advice or concurrence of the Company or the Required Banks (or, if required, all of the Banks), as
applicable, as it deems appropriate and it shall first be indemnified to its satisfaction by the
Banks, <U>provided</U> that unless and until such Agent shall have received such advice, such
Agent may take or refrain from taking any action, as such Agent shall deem advisable and in the
best interests of the Banks. Each Agent shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in

under this Agreement in its individual capacity as any Bank and may exercise the same as though it
were not an Agent, and the terms <B>&#147;Bank,&#148; </B>and <B>&#147;Banks&#148; </B>shall include each Agent in its individual

such Agent) at any time upon thirty (30)&nbsp;days&#146; prior notice to the Company, the Agents and the
other Banks. The Required Banks, with the consent of the Company (such consent not to be

terminated pursuant to this <U>Section&nbsp;10.5</U>. Subsequent to the effective date of such
resignation or termination, the resigning or terminated (as applicable) Agent shall have no further

acknowledges and represents that it will, independently of and without reliance upon any Agent, and
based solely upon its own expertise (and the expertise of its agents and independent advisors, if
any) and upon such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to
make its own credit analysis of the Company and its own decisions with respect to this Agreement.

undertaking, act or judgment of the Company or any other Person, or for any error of judgment or
any action taken or omitted to be taken by such Agent (except and to the extent that the same

ascertain or inquire as to the performance or observance of any term of any of the Loan Documents.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Agent: (a)&nbsp;may consult with legal counsel
selected by it and shall not be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken in good faith by
it in accordance with the advice of such counsel; (b)&nbsp;makes no warranty or representation and shall

received from, the Company or any other Person, except for Collateral Agent&#146;s responsibility under
<U>Section&nbsp;10.8</U>; (c)&nbsp;makes no warranty or representation and shall not be responsible for the
due execution, validity, enforceability, sufficiency or collectibility of any of the Loan
Documents; (d)&nbsp;shall incur no liability under or in respect of any such agreement or document by
acting upon any notice (by telephone or otherwise), or writing (including telex and telegraphic

willful misconduct of such Bank.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(c)&nbsp;If a Bank shall become aware that it is entitled to claim a refund from a governmental
authority in respect of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes paid by the Company pursuant to this
<U>Section&nbsp;11.4</U>, including Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been
indemnified by the Company, or with respect to which the Company has paid Additional Amounts
pursuant hereto, it shall promptly notify the Company of the availability of such refund claim and,
if such Bank determines in good faith that making a claim for refund will not have a material
adverse effect on its taxes or business operations, shall, within 30&nbsp;days after receipt of a
request by the Company, make a claim to such governmental authority for such refund at the
Company&#146;s expense. If a Bank receives a refund in respect of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes
paid by the Company pursuant hereto, it shall within 30&nbsp;days from the date of such receipt pay over
such refund to the Company (but only to the extent of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes paid
pursuant to hereto, including indemnity payments made or Additional Amounts paid, by the Company
under this <U>Section&nbsp;11.4</U> with respect to the Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to
such refund), net of all out of pocket expenses of such Bank and without interest (other than
interest paid by the relevant governmental authority with respect to such refund).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(d)&nbsp;If any Bank is or becomes eligible under any applicable law, regulation, treaty or other
rule to a reduced rate of taxation, or a complete exemption from withholding, with respect to
Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes on payments made to it by the Company, such Bank shall, upon the
request, and at the cost and expense, of the Company, complete and deliver from time to time any
certificate, form or other document requested by the Company, the completion and delivery of which
are a precondition to obtaining the benefit of such reduced rate or exemption, <U>provided</U>
that the taking of such action by such Bank, would not, in the reasonable judgment of such Bank be
disadvantageous or prejudicial to such Bank or inconsistent with its internal policies or legal or
regulatory restrictions. For any period with respect to which a Bank has failed to provide any
such certificate, form or other document requested by the Company, such Bank shall not be entitled
to any payment under this <U>Section&nbsp;11.4</U> in respect of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes
that would not have been imposed but for such failure.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(e)&nbsp;Each Bank organized under the laws of a jurisdiction in the United States, any State
thereof or the District of Columbia (other than Banks that are corporations or otherwise exempt
from United States backup withholding Tax) shall (i)&nbsp;deliver to the Company, upon execution hereof
(or, with respect to Persons becoming Banks hereunder by assignment, upon execution of the relevant
assignment agreement), two original copies of United States Internal Revenue Form W-9 or any
successor form, properly completed and duly executed by such Bank, certifying that such Bank is
exempt from United States backup withholding Tax on payments of interest made under the Loan
Documents and (ii)&nbsp;thereafter, at each time it is so reasonably requested in writing by the
Company, deliver within a reasonable time two original copies of an updated Form W-9 or any
successor form thereto.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(f)&nbsp;Each Bank that is organized under the laws of a jurisdiction other than the United States,
any State thereof or the District of Columbia (each such Bank, a <B>&#147;Foreign Bank&#148;</B>) that is entitled
to an exemption from or reduction of withholding Tax under the laws of the jurisdiction in which
the Company is located, or any treaty to which such jurisdiction is a party, with respect to
payments under the Loan Documents shall deliver to the Company, upon execution hereof (or, with
respect to Persons becoming Banks hereunder by assignment, upon execution of the relevant
assignment agreement), such properly completed and duly executed documentation prescribed by
applicable law or reasonably requested by the Company as will permit such payments to be made
without withholding or at a reduced rate, unless in the good faith opinion of the Foreign Bank such
documentation would expose the Foreign Bank to any material adverse consequences or risk. Such
documentation shall be delivered by each Foreign Bank on or before the date it becomes a Bank and
on or before the date, if any, such Foreign Bank changes its applicable lending office by
designating a different lending office with respect to its Loans (a <B>&#147;New Lending Office&#148;</B>). In
addition, each Foreign Bank shall deliver such forms promptly upon the obsolescence or invalidity
of any form previously delivered by such Foreign Bank. Each Bank (and, in the case of a Foreign
Bank, its lending office), represents that on the date hereof, payments made hereunder by the
Company to it would not be subject to United States Federal withholding tax.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(g)&nbsp;Notwithstanding the provisions of <U>subsection (a)</U> and <U>(b)</U> above, the
Company shall not be required to indemnify any Foreign Bank, or to pay any Additional Amounts to
any Foreign Bank, in respect of United States Federal withholding tax pursuant to <U>subsection
(a)</U> or <U>(b)</U> above, (A)&nbsp;to the extent that the obligation to withhold amounts with
respect to United States Federal withholding tax existed on the date such Foreign Bank became a
Bank; (B)&nbsp;with respect to payments to a New Lending Office with respect to a Loan, but only to the
extent that such withholding tax exceeds any withholding tax that would have been imposed on such
Bank had it not designated such New Lending Office; (C)&nbsp;with respect to a change by such Foreign
Bank of the jurisdiction in which it is organized, incorporated, controlled or managed, or in which
it is doing business, from the date such Foreign Bank changed such jurisdiction, but only to the
extent that such withholding tax exceeds any withholding tax that would have been imposed on such
Bank had it not changed the jurisdiction in which it is organized, incorporated, controlled or
managed, or in which it is doing business; or (D)&nbsp;to the extent that the obligation to pay such
indemnity payment or Additional Amounts would not have arisen but for a failure by such Foreign
Bank to comply with the provisions of <U>Section&nbsp;11.4(f)</U>.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(h)&nbsp;If any Bank requests compensation under this <U>Section&nbsp;11.4</U>, or if the Company is
required to pay any additional amount to any governmental authority for the account of any Bank
pursuant to this <U>Section&nbsp;11.4</U>, then such Bank shall use reasonable efforts to designate a
different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and
obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates with the object of avoiding
or eliminating the amounts payable pursuant to this <U>Section&nbsp;11.4</U>, <U>provided</U> that
such designation or assignment shall be on such terms that such Bank and its lending office, in
such Bank&#146;s sole judgment, suffer no economic, legal, regulatory or other disadvantage and would
not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Bank. The Company hereby agrees to pay all reasonable
costs and expenses incurred by any Bank in connection with any such designation or assignment.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt">If Bank requests compensation under this <U>Section&nbsp;11.4</U>, or if the Company is required to pay
any additional amount to any governmental authority for the account of any Bank pursuant to this
<U>Section&nbsp;11.4</U>, then the Company may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such
Bank, require such Bank to assign and delegate, without recourse, in accordance with and subject to
the restrictions contained in <U>Section&nbsp;11.1</U>, all of such Bank&#146;s interests, rights and
obligations under this Agreement to one or more assignees that shall assume such obligations (which
assignee or assignees may be one or more other Banks); <U>provided</U> that (i)&nbsp;such Bank shall
have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans, accrued and
unpaid interest thereon, accrued and unpaid fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder from
the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the
Company (in the case of all other amounts) and (ii)&nbsp;such assignment will result in a reduction in
such compensation or payments. A Bank shall not be required to make any such assignment and
delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Bank or otherwise, the circumstances
entitling the Company to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt">A certificate of the relevant Bank setting forth the basis for any amounts (and the calculation
thereof and methodology in calculating, each in reasonable detail) claimed under this <U>Section
11.4</U> shall be delivered to the Company and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Failure
or delay on the part of a Bank to demand compensation of any amount under this Section shall not
constitute a waiver of such Bank&#146;s right to demand such compensation; <U>provided</U> that the
Company shall not be required to compensate any such Bank for any amounts claimed under this
Section that are incurred more than 90&nbsp;days prior to the date that such Bank notifies the Company
of the circumstances giving rise to such amounts and such Bank&#146;s intention to claim compensation
therefor; <U>provided</U>, further, that if the circumstances giving rise to such amounts have
retroactive effect, then the 90-day period referred to above shall be extended to include the
period of retroactive effect thereof.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(i)&nbsp;Any payment required to be made by the Company to any Bank under this <U>Section&nbsp;11.4</U>
shall be deemed an Obligation and be secured by the Collateral.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">Section&nbsp;11.5 <U>Choice of Law; Jurisdiction</U>. The Loan Documents (other than those
containing a contrary express choice of law provision) shall be construed in accordance with the
laws of the State of Illinois (excluding choice-of-law principles of the law of such State that
would require the application of the laws of a jurisdiction other than such State), but giving
effect to federal laws applicable to national banks. The Company and the Banks hereby irrevocably
submit to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of any United States federal or Illinois state court
sitting in Chicago, Illinois in any action or proceedings arising out of or relating to any Loan
Documents and the Company and the Banks hereby irrevocably agree that all claims in respect of such
action or proceeding may be heard and determined in any such court.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">Section&nbsp;11.6 <U>Headings</U>. Section headings in the Loan Documents are for convenience of
reference only, and shall not govern the interpretation of any of the provisions of the Loan
Documents.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">Section&nbsp;11.7 <U>Entire Agreement</U>. The Loan Documents embody the entire agreement and
understanding among the Company and the Banks and supersede all prior agreements and understandings
among the Company and the Banks relating to the subject matter thereof.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">Section&nbsp;11.8 <U>Several Obligations</U>. The respective obligations of the Banks hereunder
are several and not joint and no Bank shall be the partner or agent of any other. The failure of
any Bank to perform any of its obligations hereunder shall not relieve any other Bank from any of
its obligations hereunder.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">Section&nbsp;11.9 <U>Expenses; Indemnification</U>.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(a)&nbsp;The Company shall reimburse each Agent and each Bank for any reasonable costs, internal
charges and out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable attorneys&#146; fees and time charges of
attorneys, which attorneys may be employees of such Agent or such Bank, as applicable) paid or
incurred by such Agent or such Bank, as applicable, in connection with the collection, liquidation
and enforcement of the Loan Documents and/or the Collateral. The Company further agrees to
indemnify each Agent, each Bank and their respective directors, officers and employees (each an
<B>&#147;Indemnified Party&#148;</B>) against all losses, claims, damages, penalties, judgments, liabilities and
expenses (including, without limitation, all expenses of litigation or preparation therefor) which
any of them may pay or incur arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the other Loan
Documents, the transactions contemplated hereby or the direct or indirect application or proposed
application of the proceeds of any Loan hereunder (all of the foregoing being collectively referred
to as <B>&#147;Indemnified Amounts&#148;</B>), excluding, however, in all of the foregoing instances, Indemnified
Amounts arising from the gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the Indemnified
Party seeking indemnification and Indemnified Amounts consisting of taxes imposed on or measured by
the overall net income of the Indemnified Party seeking indemnification.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(b)&nbsp;If, after the date hereof, any law or any governmental rule, regulation, policy, guideline
or directive (whether or not having the force of law) is adopted, or there is any change in the
interpretation thereof, or the compliance of any Bank with such, which, in any case, affects the
amount of capital required or expected to be maintained by such Bank or any corporation controlling
such Bank, and such Bank reasonably determines the amount of capital required is increased by or
based upon the existence of this Agreement or its Commitment hereunder and such increased capital
results in increased costs to such Bank, then, such Bank shall notify the Company of such fact and
shall provide a reasonably detailed description of such increased costs in the notice (<B>&#147;Increased
Cost Notice&#148;</B>), together with documentation from the relevant regulatory body setting forth such
increased capital requirement, and within 15&nbsp;days of the Company&#146;s receipt of such Increased Cost
Notice, the Company shall, in its sole discretion, determine whether to terminate such Bank&#146;s
Commitment and obligation to make Loans hereunder, or to attempt to negotiate with such Bank a
revised commitment fee (which revision shall not constitute an amendment to <U>Section&nbsp;2.8</U>
hereof for the purposes of <U>Section&nbsp;9.2</U>) and any other reimbursements provided for hereunder
which reflect such Bank&#146;s increased costs. In the event that the Company determines to terminate
such Bank&#146;s Commitment and obligation to make Loans hereunder, the Company shall send written
notice to such Bank within 15&nbsp;days of the Company&#146;s receipt of the Increased Cost Notice specifying
a date at least 30&nbsp;days thereafter on which such Bank&#146;s Commitment and obligation to make Loans
hereunder shall be terminated. In the event that the Company determines to attempt to negotiate
with such Bank a revised commitment fee and other reimbursements, and the Company and such Bank are
unable to agree, within 30&nbsp;days of the date of the Increased Cost Notice, upon such revised fees
and other reimbursements, such Bank may send written notice to the Company, or the Company may send
written notice to such Bank specifying a date at least 30&nbsp;days thereafter on which the Bank&#146;s
Commitment and obligation to make Loans hereunder shall be terminated. Any payment required to be
made by the Company under this <U>Section&nbsp;11.9(b)</U> shall be deemed an Obligation and be secured
by the Collateral.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(c)&nbsp;At least 45&nbsp;days prior to the proposed consummation date of any merger or consolidation of
the Company with or into any other Person in which the Company shall not be the surviving entity
(such transaction, a <B>&#147;Restructuring&#148;</B>), the Company will give written notice thereof to
Administrative Agent (a <B>&#147;Restructuring Notice&#148;</B>), which notice shall set forth the material terms
and conditions of such Restructuring, including the identity of the surviving entity of such
Restructuring (the <B>&#147;Survivor&#148;</B>). Administrative Agent shall promptly provide a copy of the
Restructuring Notice to each Bank. Upon receipt of a Restructuring Notice, a Bank may elect, in
its sole discretion, to terminate its Commitment hereunder by notifying the Company and
Administrative Agent thereof, which may be by telephone (a <B>&#147;Termination Notice&#148;</B>) within 15&nbsp;days of
such Bank&#146;s receipt of the Restructuring Notice, which termination shall become effective no sooner
than 30&nbsp;days after the Company&#146;s receipt of the Termination Notice. Any Bank that fails to deliver
a Termination Notice within 15&nbsp;days after its receipt of a Restructuring Notice shall be deemed to
have elected to terminate its Commitment.

Termination Date&#148;</B>. Any such termination shall not accelerate the maturity of any Loans outstanding
to such Bank; commitment fees to such Bank shall cease to accrue as of its Accelerated Termination
Date; and the Company shall be responsible for any and all Obligations and accrued and unpaid costs
(including increased costs), fees and expenses incurred with respect to such Bank prior to its

held to be inoperative, unenforceable, or invalid in any jurisdiction shall, as to that
jurisdiction, be inoperative, unenforceable, or invalid without affecting the remaining provisions
in that jurisdiction or the operation, enforceability, or validity of that provision in any other
jurisdiction, and to this end the provisions of all Loan Documents are declared to be severable.

Purchaser or Participant or any prospective Purchaser or Participant, (e)&nbsp;with the consent of the
Company or (f)&nbsp;to the extent such Company Information becomes publicly available other than as a
result of a breach of its confidentiality obligations as described in this <U>Section&nbsp;11.12</U>.

identifies each Person that opens an account, including any deposit account, treasury management
account, loan, other extension of credit, or other financial services product. Accordingly, when
the Company opens an account, Administrative Agent, Collateral Agent and the Banks will ask for the
Company&#146;s name, tax identification number, business address, and other information that will allow
Administrative Agent, Collateral Agent and the Banks to identify such Company. Administrative
Agent, Collateral Agent and the Banks may also ask to see the Company&#146;s legal organizational
documents or other identifying documents.
