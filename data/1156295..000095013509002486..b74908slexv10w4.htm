Company&#146;s common stock equal in number to (A)&nbsp;2,571, if the closing price per share
of the Company&#146;s common stock on the applicable Grant Date, measured in U.S. dollars
(the &#147;Applicable Share Price&#148;), is equal to or less than one (1)&nbsp;U.S. Dollar; or (B)
$2,571.87 divided by the Applicable Share Price, if the Applicable Share Price is

quarter preceding a Grant Date are insufficient to provide for any required tax
withholding with respect to shares or other amounts to be delivered on such Grant

employment is terminated for any reason during the Salary Reduction Period, in
addition to Final Compensation payable pursuant to Section&nbsp;4, the Company shall
deliver to the Executive (or, in the event of his death, the Executive&#146;s estate) an
amount of shares of the Company&#146;s common stock equal to (i)&nbsp;the number of shares to
which the Executive would have otherwise been entitled under Section&nbsp;3(f)(ii) on the
first Grant Date following the date of termination if the Executive&#146;s employment had
not been terminated, multiplied by (ii)&nbsp;a fraction, the numerator of which is the
number of days prior to and including the date of termination during the quarter in
which the date of termination occurs and the denominator of which is the total
number of days in such quarter. The resulting share total shall be rounded down to
the nearest whole share and any fractional amount shall be paid in cash.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may in its discretion pay to the
Executive the cash value of the shares to which the Executive is otherwise entitled
under this Section&nbsp;3(f)(iii), in lieu of such shares. The cash value of the shares
shall be calculated based upon the closing price per share of the Company&#146;s common
stock on the first Grant Date following the date of termination. Any shares or cash
payable under this Section&nbsp;3(f)(iii) shall be paid on such first Grant Date
following the date of termination.

(as such term is defined in Section&nbsp;4(c)), then for purposes of Section 4(d) the
Base Salary rate in effect on the date of termination shall equal the annualized
base salary rate in effect immediately prior to the Salary Reduction Period.
