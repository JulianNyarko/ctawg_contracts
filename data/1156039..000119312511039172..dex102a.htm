Section&nbsp;17.1 of the WellPoint Incentive Compensation Plan (the &#147;Plan&#148;), WellPoint, Inc. amends the Plan, effective December&nbsp;8, 2010, to provide as follows: </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT

otherwise be paid on the Shares subject to or issued pursuant to an Award <U>(including Restricted Stock Units)</U> but that have not been issued or delivered, as described in Article XIII. </FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">2. Section&nbsp;13.1 is amended in its entirety to read as follows: </FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6px;margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:4%; text-indent:4%"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">13.1 <U>Dividend Equivalents</U>. Unless otherwise provided by the Committee, no adjustment shall be made in the Shares
issuable or taken into account under Awards on account of cash dividends that may be paid or other rights that may be issued to the holders of Shares prior to issuance of such Shares under such Award. The Committee may grant Dividend Equivalents
based on the dividends declared on Shares that are subject to any Award, including any Award the payment or settlement of which is deferred pursuant to Section&nbsp;21.6. <U>The Committee may also grant Dividend Equivalents based on the dividends
that would have been declared on Restricted Stock Units or Performance Units had such Units been Shares of Restricted Stock or Performance Units, as the case may be. In the event that payment or settlement of an Award is contingent on achievement of
performance goals, no Dividend Equivalents shall be paid on any unearned portion of the Award. </U>Dividend Equivalents may be credited as of the dividend payment dates, during the period between the date the Award is granted and the date the Award
becomes payable, terminates or expires. Dividend Equivalents may be subject to any limitations and/or restrictions determined by the Committee. Dividend Equivalents shall be converted to cash or additional Shares by such formula and at such time,
and shall be paid at such times, as may be determined by the Committee. Unless the Award Agreement provides otherwise, Dividend Equivalents shall be paid to the Participant at least annually, not later than the fifteenth day of the third month
following the end of the calendar year in which the Dividend Equivalents are credited (or, if later, the fifteenth day of the third month following the end of the calendar year in which the Dividend Equivalents are no longer subject to a substantial
risk of forfeiture within the meaning of Code Section&nbsp;409A). Any Dividend Equivalents that are accumulated and paid after the date specified in the preceding sentence shall be explicitly set forth in a separate arrangement that provides for the
payment of the dividend equivalents at a time and in a manner that satisfies the requirements of Code Section&nbsp;409A. No Dividend Equivalents shall relate to Shares underlying an Option or SAR unless such Dividend Equivalent rights are explicitly
set forth as a separate arrangement and do not cause any such Option or SAR to be subject to Code Section&nbsp;409A. </FONT></P>
