</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>WHEREAS</B>, the Executive has contributed substantially to the success of the Employer and the
Employer desires that the Executive continue in its employ;
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>WHEREAS</B>, to encourage the Executive to remain an employee of the Employer, the Employer is
willing to provide salary continuation benefits to the Executive, payable out of the Employer&#146;s

<DIV align="center" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 18pt"><B>ARTICLE 1<BR>
DEFINITIONS</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever used in this Agreement, the following terms have the meanings specified &#151;
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>1.1</b><i> &#147;Accrual Balance&#148; </I>means the liability that should be accrued by the Employer under
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (&#147;GAAP&#148;) for the Employer&#146;s
obligation to the Executive under this Agreement, by applying Accounting Principles Board Opinion
No.&nbsp;12, as amended by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.&nbsp;106, and the calculation
method and discount rate specified hereinafter. The Accrual Balance shall be determined by the
liability accrued by the Bank as of the Effective Date. The projected Accrual Balance is detailed
on Schedule&nbsp;A including annual accruals. The Accrual Balance shall be calculated assuming a level
principal amount and interest as the discount rate is accrued each period. The principal accrual
is determined such that when it is credited with interest each month, the Accrual Balance at Normal
Retirement Age equals the present value of the normal retirement benefits described in Section
2.1.1(a) and (b). At the end of each Plan Year, the Accrual Balance shall be adjusted to reflect
the Employer&#146;s obligation under Sections&nbsp;2.1.1(a) in terms of the Executive&#146;s actual base salary
for that Plan Year. The discount rate means the rate used by the Plan Administrator for
determining the Accrual Balance. The rate is based on the yield on a 20-year corporate bond rated
Aa by Moody&#146;s, rounded to the nearest <FONT style="font-size: 70%"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT>/<FONT style="font-size: 60%">4</FONT>%, or as otherwise determined by the governing Regulatory
body. The initial discount rate is 5.75%. In its sole discretion, the Plan Administrator may
adjust the discount rate to maintain the rate within reasonable standards according to GAAP and
consistent with the Interagency Advisory on Accounting for Deferred Compensation Agreements which
states that the &#147;cost of those benefits shall be accrued over that period of the employee&#146;s service
in a systematic and rational manner.&#148;

shall provide detailed supporting calculations both to the Bank and the Executive within 15
business days after receipt of notice from the Bank or the Executive that there has been a Gross-Up
Payment Amount, or such earlier time as is requested by the Bank. All fees and expenses of the
Accounting Firm shall be borne solely by the Bank. The Bank shall enter into any reasonable
agreement requested by the Accounting Firm in connection with the performance of its services
hereunder. If the Accounting Firm determines that no Excise Tax is payable by the Executive, the
Accounting Firm shall furnish the Executive with a written opinion to that effect, and to the
effect that failure to report an Excise Tax, if any, on the Executive&#146;s applicable federal income
tax return will not result in the imposition of a negligence or similar penalty. &nbsp;The Determination
by the Accounting Firm shall be binding on the Bank and the Executive. If, after a Determination by
the Accounting Firm, the Executive is required to make a payment of additional Excise Tax
(&#147;Underpayment&#148;), the Accounting Firm shall determine the amount of the Underpayment that has
occurred. The Underpayment (together with interest at the rate provided in section 1274(d)(2)(B) of
the Code) shall be paid promptly by the Bank to or for the benefit of the Executive. If the
Gross-Up Payment Amount exceeds the amount necessary to reimburse the Executive for his Excise Tax
(&#147;Overpayment&#148;), the Accounting Firm shall determine the amount of the Overpayment that has been
made. The Overpayment (together with interest at the rate provided in section 1274(d)(2)(B) of the
Code) shall be paid promptly by the Executive to or for the benefit of the Bank. Provided that his
expenses are reimbursed by the Bank, the Executive shall cooperate with any reasonable requests by
the Bank in any contests or disputes with the Internal Revenue Service relating to the Excise Tax.
&nbsp;If the Accounting Firm is serving as accountant or auditor for the individual, entity, or group
effecting the Change in Control, the Executive, in his sole discretion, may appoint another
nationally recognized public accounting firm to make the Determinations required hereunder (in
which case the term &#147;Accounting Firm&#148; as used in this Agreement shall be deemed to refer to the
accounting firm appointed by the Executive under this Section).
