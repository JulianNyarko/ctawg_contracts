(as defined in the Security Agreement) has occurred and is continuing, such Guarantor may make loans to and receive payments from any Obligor with respect to Intercompany Indebtedness to the extent not prohibited by the terms of the Loan Documents.
Notwithstanding any right of any Guarantor to ask, demand, sue for, take or receive any payment from any Obligor, all rights, liens and security interests of such Guarantor, whether now or hereafter arising and howsoever existing, in any assets of
any other Obligor shall be and are subordinated to the rights of the Secured Parties and the Administrative Agent in those assets. No Guarantor shall have any right to possession of any such asset or to foreclose upon any such asset, whether by

have been terminated. If all or any part of the assets of any Obligor, or the proceeds thereof, are subject to any distribution, division or application to the creditors of such Obligor, whether partial or complete, voluntary or involuntary, and
whether by reason of liquidation, bankruptcy, arrangement, receivership, assignment for the benefit of creditors or any other action or proceeding, or if the business of any such Obligor is dissolved or if substantially all of the assets of any such

Obligations, due or to become due, until such Guaranteed Obligations (other than the Unliquidated Obligations) shall have first been fully paid and satisfied (or, in the case of Letters of Credit, cash collateralized pursuant to terms reasonably
acceptable to the Administrative Agent). Should any payment, distribution, security or instrument or proceeds thereof be received by the applicable Guarantor upon or with respect to the Intercompany Indebtedness after any Insolvency Event and prior
to the satisfaction of all of the Guaranteed Obligations and the termination of all financing arrangements pursuant to any Loan Document among the Borrower and the Secured Parties, such Guarantor shall receive and hold the same in trust, as trustee,
for the benefit of the Secured Parties and shall forthwith deliver the same to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Secured Parties, in precisely the form received (except for the endorsement or assignment of the Guarantor where
necessary), for application to any of the Guaranteed Obligations, due or not due, and, until so delivered, the same shall be held in trust by the Guarantor as the property of the Secured Parties. If any such Guarantor fails to make any such
endorsement or assignment to the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent or any of its officers or employees is irrevocably authorized to make the same. Each Guarantor agrees that until the Guaranteed Obligations (other than the Unliquidated
Obligations) have been paid in full (in cash) and satisfied and all financing arrangements pursuant to any Loan Document among the Borrower and the Secured Parties have been terminated, no Guarantor will assign or transfer to any Person (other than
the Administrative Agent) any claim any such Guarantor has or may have against any Obligor. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">SECTION&nbsp;7. <U>Contribution
