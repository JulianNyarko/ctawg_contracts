that any provision of this Agreement (or of any award of compensation, including equity compensation or benefits) would cause the Executive to incur any additional tax or interest under Code Section&nbsp;409A and the Company concurs with such belief
or the Company (without any obligation whatsoever to do so) independently makes such determination, the Company shall, after consulting with Executive, reform such provision to attempt to comply with Code Section&nbsp;409A through good faith
modifications to the minimum extent reasonably appropriate to conform with Code Section&nbsp;409A; provided that the Company shall not reform any such provisions if such action would or could be reasonably be expected to result in any material
increased costs or material liability to the Company. To the extent that any provision hereof is modified in order to comply with or be exempt from Code Section&nbsp;409A, such modification shall be made in good faith and shall, to the maximum
extent reasonably possible, maintain the original intent and economic benefit to the Executive and the Company of the applicable provision without violating the provisions of Code Section&nbsp;409A. </FONT></P> <P

Agreement, references to a &#147;termination,&#148; &#147;termination of employment&#148; or like terms shall mean &#147;separation from service.&#148; If the Executive is deemed on the date of termination to be a &#147;specified employee&#148;
within the meaning of that term under Code Section&nbsp;409A(a)(2)(B), then with regard to any payment or the provision of any benefit that is specified as subject to this Section or that is otherwise considered deferred compensation under Code
Section&nbsp;409A payable on account of a &#147;separation from service,&#148; such payment or benefit shall be made or provided at the date which is the earlier of (i)&nbsp;the expiration of the six (6)-month period measured from the date of such
&#147;separation from service&#148; of the Executive, and (ii)&nbsp;the date of the Executive&#146;s death (the &#147;<U>Delay Period</U>&#148;). Upon the expiration of the Delay Period, all payments and benefits delayed pursuant to this

arrangement covered by Internal Revenue Code Section&nbsp;105(b) solely because such expenses are subject to a limit related to the period the arrangement is in effect and (iii)&nbsp;such payments shall be made on or before the last day of
Executive&#146;s taxable year following the taxable year in which the expense occurred. Any tax gross-up payment as provided herein shall be made in any event no later than the end of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in
which the Executive remits the related taxes, and any reimbursement of expenses incurred due to a tax audit or litigation shall be made no later than the end of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the taxes that are
