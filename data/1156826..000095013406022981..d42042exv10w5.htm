HISTORY AND PURPOSE
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Archstone Communities Trust 1996 Share Option Plan for Outside Trustees (the &#147;Plan&#148;) was
established by Archstone Communities Trust (formerly known as Security Capital Pacific Trust) (the
&#147;Company&#148;) to promote the interests of the Company and its shareholders by enhancing the Company&#146;s
ability to attract and retain the services of experienced and knowledgeable trustees and by
encouraging such trustees to acquire a proprietary interest in the Company. Effective as of
October&nbsp;29, 2001, Archstone-Smith Trust assumed sponsorship of the Plan and was substituted for
Archstone Communities Trust as the &#147;Company&#148; under the Plan and the Plan was amended, restated and
continued in the form of &#147;Archstone-Smith Trust 1996 Share Option Plan for Outside Trustees&#148;.
Effective as of January&nbsp;1, 2002, the Plan was amended, restated and continued in the form of
&#147;Archstone-Smith Trust Equity Plan for Outside Trustees&#148;. The following provisions constitute an
amendment, restatement and continuation of the Plan as in effect immediately prior to November&nbsp;1,
2002 (the &#147;Effective Date&#148;).

provided, however, in the event the Administrator elects to terminate outstanding Options, the
Optionee shall have the right immediately prior to such merger or consolidation to exercise his
