and the Accuracy of HIV Testing</B></FONT>



<P align="center" style="font-size: 14pt"><FONT style="font-size: 12pt"><B>-Total US Government funded dollars awarded to SeraCare exceeds $35&nbsp;million over the past two<BR>
years -</B></FONT>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt">MILFORD, MA, September&nbsp;29, 2009&#151;SeraCare Life Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ: SRLS) today announced that
the Company has been awarded two new contracts from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC)&nbsp;and the
National Institutes of Health (NIH)&nbsp;and that a third existing contract has been expanded by the NIH
to support federally-funded HIV research and testing. These contracts represent a combined $10.8
million in new funding if all options are exercised over the life of the contracts.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt">&#147;The government sector is an important customer of our services business and these recent awards
demonstrate SeraCare&#146;s fundamental role in the support of government-sponsored research projects
and, specifically, our leadership position in providing the highest quality services in support of
HIV research and testing,&#148; said Susan Vogt, President and Chief Executive Officer of SeraCare Life
Sciences. &#147;Moreover, we believe these types of projects may increase given the influx of federal
stimulus dollars for government sponsored research.&#148;


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt">Under a new contract awarded by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC)&nbsp;as part of the CDC&#146;s HIV-1
Rapid Test Proficiency Program, SeraCare will support efforts to ensure that laboratories
performing HIV-1 assays are achieving accurate results. The Company will provide well characterized
HIV-1 positive and negative plasma and will test, dispense and distribute panels to approximately
650 laboratories participating in this performance evaluation program, which is used as a
self-assessment tool for facilities performing HIV-1 rapid testing.. The five-year contract is
valued at over $3.6&nbsp;million if all options are exercised by the CDC.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt">Under a second new contract awarded by PPD, Inc. to support the NIH&#146;s Division for HIV Clinical
Research Support Services, SeraCare will collect, characterize, assemble and distribute a
comprehensive panel of current worldwide HIV strains. These efforts are designed to establish&nbsp;a
standardized&nbsp;set of viral reagents to help monitor and update blood screening and diagnostic
assays&#151;activities that play a critical role in insuring that the world&#146;s blood supply is safe&#151;and
to assist in the development of vaccines for HIV. The 15&nbsp;month contract is valued at $2&nbsp;million.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt">Under an expanded, existing contract with the NIH to support the National Heart, Lung, and Blood
Institute Biologic Specimen Repository, Contract #N01-HB-87144, SeraCare will support the growth
of the repository and quality control the historic AIDS and AIDS-related studies in the collection
in preparation for anticipated broader use. The $5.2&nbsp;million expansion increases the remaining
value of the contract over the next two years to $6.3&nbsp;million.
