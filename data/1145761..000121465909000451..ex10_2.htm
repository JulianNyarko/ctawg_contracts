may hereafter be amended or interpreted (but in the case of any such amendment
or interpretation, only to the extent that such amendment or interpretation
permits the Company to provide broader indemnification rights than were
permitted prior thereto). The parties hereto intend that this Agreement shall
provide for indemnification in excess of that expressly permitted by statute,
including, without limitation, any indemnification provided by the Company&#8217;s
Articles of Incorporation as amended, its bylaws as amended, vote of its
stockholders or disinterested directors, or applicable law.</font></div>

would not be permitted to be so indemnified under applicable law, the Company
shall be entitled to be reimbursed by Indemnitee (who hereby agrees to reimburse
the Company) for all such amounts theretofore paid. If Indemnitee has commenced
legal proceedings in a court of competent jurisdiction to secure a determination
that Indemnitee should be indemnified under applicable law, as provided in
Section 4, any determination made by the Reviewing Party that Indemnitee would
not be permitted to be indemnified under applicable law shall not be binding and
Indemnitee shall not be required to reimburse the Company for any Expense
Advance until a final judicial determination is made with respect thereto (as to
which all rights of appeal therefrom have been exhausted or have

rights of Indemnitee to indemnity payments and Expense Advances under this
Agreement or any other agreement or under applicable law or the Company&#8217;s

relating to indemnification for Indemnifiable Events, the Company shall seek
legal advice only from Independent Counsel selected by Indemnitee and approved
by the Company and who has not otherwise performed services for the Company or
the Indemnitee (other than in connection with indemnification matters) within
the last five years. The Independent Counsel shall not include any person who,
under the applicable standards of professional conduct then prevailing would
have a conflict of interest in representing either the Company or Indemnitee in
an action to determine Indemnitee&#8217;s rights under this Agreement. Such counsel,
among other things, shall render its written opinion to the Company and
Indemnitee as to whether and to what extent the Indemnitee should be permitted
to be indemnified under applicable law. The Company agrees to pay the reasonable
fees of the Independent Counsel and to indemnify fully such counsel against any
and all expenses (including attorney&#8217;s fees), claims, liabilities, loss, and
damages arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the engagement of
Independent Counsel pursuant hereto.</font></div>

brought by Indemnitee against the Company to enforce this Agreement (other than
an action brought to enforce a claim for Expenses incurred in defending a

has been tendered to the Company) that it is not permissible under applicable

connection with any such action or any determination by the Reviewing Party or
otherwise as to whether Indemnitee is entitled to be indemnified hereunder, the
burden of proving such a defense or determination shall be on the Company.
Neither the failure of the Reviewing Party or the Company (including its Board,
independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) to have made a determination
prior to the commencement of such action by Indemnitee that indemnification of
the claimant is proper under the circumstances because Indemnitee has met the
standard of conduct set forth in applicable law, nor an actual determination by
the Reviewing Party or Company (including its Board, independent legal counsel,
or its stockholders) that the Indemnitee had not met such applicable standard of
conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that the
Indemnitee has not met the applicable standard of conduct. For purposes of this
Agreement, the termination of any claim, action, suit, or proceeding, by
judgment, order, settlement (whether with or without court approval),
conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere, or its equivalent shall not
create a presumption that Indemnitee did not meet any particular standard of
conduct or have any particular belief or that a court has determined that
indemnification is not permitted by applicable law.</font></div>
