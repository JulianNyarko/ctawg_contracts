shareholders  with equal  ownership  interests or equal  control  interests,  by
contract or otherwise,  then each such partner,  member,  or shareholder will be

         (ii)  This License Agreement is a legal,  valid and binding  obligation
               of each Licensor and the execution,  delivery and  performance of

         (vi)  Neither   Licensor  has  pledged,   hypothecated,   or  otherwise
               encumbered  its Customer  List;  and the  Customer  Lists are not
               subject to any pledge, security interest, or other encumbrance.

5.  CONFIDENTIALITY.  Each  Licensor  agrees  that  it will  hold  in  strictest
