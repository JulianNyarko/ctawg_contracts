occupancy of all or any portion of the Property, including a detailed explanation of the nature and purpose thereof, at the following address of the State Department: Department of State, Washington, DC 20520, Attention: Assistant Secretary for
Administration, or at such other address as Grantor may, from time to time, designate by written notice to Grantee. Grantee shall also provide promptly such additional information as may reasonably be requested by the State Department. The State

acceptable uses or occupants in the surrounding area. The State Department shall inform Grantee in writing of the Secretary&#146;s basis for any stated concerns, and shall indicate whether each such concern is a safety or security issue or a
continued operation or incompatibility with surrounding area concern. If the State Department does not approve or disapprove the proposed Transfer in writing within thirty (30)&nbsp;calendar days of the State Department&#146;s confirmed receipt of
Grantee&#146;s request for consent to such Transfer, Grantee shall provide the State Department with a second request for consent to the proposed Transfer. In the event the State Department does not approve or disapprove the proposed Transfer in

action of Grantee shall be required except to provide the State Department with progress updates on the intended use, development and/or occupancy as may be reasonably requested by the State Department or to satisfy any conditions imposed by the
State Department, provided such conditions relate to the safety or security of the International Center. Any such determination based on safety or security considerations must be made personally by the Secretary, without delegation, and shall be
final and conclusive as a matter of law. Any such determination based on damage to the continued operation of the International Center or incompatibility with the character of commercially acceptable occupants or uses in the surrounding area shall
