<TD ALIGN="left" VALIGN="top"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Chicago Mercantile Exchange Inc. Directors&#146; Deferred Compensation Plan (the &#147;Plan&#148;) was established, effective as of February&nbsp;1, 1996 by Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, an Illinois not-for-profit corporation, to provide non-employee members of its Board of Directors with the opportunity to defer receipt of compensation, thereby assisting such members in planning for their future security. Pursuant to a
series of demutualization transactions and an agreement and plan of merger, effective as of November&nbsp;13, 2000, Chicago Mercantile Exchange Inc., a shareholder-owned, for-profit Delaware corporation (&#147;CME&#148;) succeeded to the assets,
liabilities and business of Chicago Mercantile Exchange and to the power, authority and responsibility of Chicago Mercantile Exchange under and with respect to the Plan. Effective as of December&nbsp;3, 2001, pursuant to a further corporate
reorganization, CME became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Chicago Mercantile Exchange Holdings Inc. (&#147;CME Holdings&#148;), and non-employee members of the Board of Directors of CME Holdings became eligible for participation in the Plan. Pursuant
to the merger on July&nbsp;12, 2007 of CBOT Holdings, Inc. into CME Holdings, CME Holdings became CME Group Inc. (&#147;CME Group&#148;). </FONT></TD></TR></TABLE> <P STYLE="font-size:6px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px">&nbsp;</P>

the Plan. The Plan Administrator may delegate all or any part of its responsibilities and powers to any person or persons selected by it. Any such delegation may be revoked at any time. Until the Plan Administrator takes action to the contrary, the
Managing Director and Chief Human Resources Officer of CME shall be delegated the power and responsibility to take all actions assigned to or permitted to be taken by the Plan Administrator under Sections 3 and 4 hereof. The Secretary of CME (or, on
behalf of the Secretary of CME, any Corporate Secretary or Assistant Secretary) shall certify to any interested person the names of the employees of CME who are, from time to time, authorized to act on behalf of the Plan Administrator and who are
responsible for the day-to-day operation and administration of the Plan. The Plan Administrator shall have the sole discretion to make decisions and take any action with respect to questions arising in connection with the Plan, including, but not
limited to, the construction and interpretation of the Plan, the resolution of any ambiguities, the determination of the conditions subject to which any benefits may be payable, the resolution of all questions concerning the status and rights of a
Participant and others under the Plan, and whether a claimant is eligible for benefits under the Plan, the determination of the amount of benefits, if any, a claimant is entitled to receive, and making any other determinations which it believes
necessary or advisable for the administration and operation of the Plan. Any such decision or action shall be final and binding upon all Participants and beneficiaries, and benefits under the Plan shall be paid only if the Plan Administrator decides
in its discretion that the claimant is entitled to them. The Plan Administrator&#146;s decision or action in respect of any of the above shall be conclusive and binding upon all Participants and their beneficiaries, heirs, assigns, administrators,
executors and any other person claiming through or under them. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2"><B>1.3.</B> <B><U>Plan Year</U></B>. The term &#147;Plan Year&#148; means

reflected on the accounting records of CME but shall not be construed to create, or require the creation of, a trust, custodial or escrow account. None of the individuals entitled to benefits under the Plan shall have any preferred claim on, or any
beneficial ownership interest in, any assets of CME or to any investment reserves, accounts, trusts or funds that CME may purchase, establish or accumulate to aid in providing the benefits under the Plan, and any rights of such individuals under the
Plan shall constitute unsecured contractual rights only. Nothing contained in the Plan shall constitute a guarantee by CME that the assets of CME shall be sufficient to pay any benefits to any person. Nothing contained in the Plan and no action
taken pursuant to its provisions shall create a trust or fiduciary relationship of any kind between CME and any person. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2"><B>1.5.</B>

<TD ALIGN="left" VALIGN="top"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">An &#147;Unforeseeable Emergency&#148; means a severe financial hardship of the Participant or beneficiary resulting from an illness or accident of the Participant or his or her
spouse or dependent (as defined in Code Section&nbsp;152(a)), loss of the Participant&#146;s property due to casualty (including the need to rebuild a home following damage to a home not otherwise covered by insurance), or other similar
extraordinary and unforeseeable circumstances arising as a result of events beyond the Participant&#146;s control. Circumstances that may constitute an Unforeseeable Emergency include the imminent foreclosure of or eviction from the
Participant&#146;s primary residence; the need to pay for medical expenses, including non-refundable deductibles, as well as for the costs of prescription drug medication; and the need to pay for the funeral expenses of a spouse or a dependent (as
defined in Code Section&nbsp;152(a)). The purchase of a home and the payment of college tuition generally are not Unforeseeable Emergencies. Whether the Participant is faced with an Unforeseeable Emergency permitting an emergency withdrawal shall be
determined by the Plan Administrator in its sole discretion, based on the relevant facts and circumstances and applying regulations and other guidance under Code Section&nbsp;409A. </FONT></TD></TR></TABLE> <P
