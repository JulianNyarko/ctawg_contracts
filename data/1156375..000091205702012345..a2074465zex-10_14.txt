           2.1   REVOLVING CREDIT LOANS. Through and including the Revolving
Credit Termination Date, each Bank severally agrees, on the terms and conditions
set forth in this Agreement and in its Note, to make Loans to the Company from
time to time in amounts not to exceed in the aggregate at any one time
outstanding the amount of its Commitment; provided, however, that if any

Bank's Commitment pursuant to SECTION 2.7, each Bank instead severally agrees,
on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, to make Loans from time
to time prior to the maturity of such unmatured Advances in amounts not to
exceed in the aggregate for all such Loans of such Bank the amount of such
Bank's ratable share (determined in proportion to its respective Commitment, as
so changed) of the excess of (i) the amount of the Aggregate Commitment, over

Banks' shares of such unmatured Advances were made and have not been
disproportionately prepaid); and provided, further that no Loan shall be made
if, after giving effect thereto, the aggregate outstanding principal of all
Loans would exceed the lesser of (A) the Aggregate Commitment or (B) the
Borrowing Base. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, the Company may borrow,
repay and reborrow at any time through the Revolving Credit


                                   10

Termination Date. The obligations of any Bank to make Loans hereunder shall
cease at 4:01 p.m. (Chicago time) on the Revolving Credit Termination Date.

          2.2   RATABLE LOANS. Each Advance hereunder shall consist of Loans
made from the several Banks, ratably in proportion to the amounts of their
respective Commitments on the date of such Advance.

          2.3   PAYMENT ON LAST DAY OF INTEREST PERIOD. Each Advance and accrued
and unpaid interest thereon shall be due and payable 30 days after such Advance
is made.

          2.4   REBORROWING OF ADVANCES. No Loans may be made hereunder to repay
Advances without the consent of all of the Banks.

          2.5   OPTIONAL PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS. The Company may from time to time
prepay, without premium or penalty, all or a portion of any outstanding Advance,
pro rata among the Banks, in accordance with their respective shares of such
Advance by giving notice of such prepayment by 10:00 a.m. (Chicago time) on the
date of such payment to each Bank. Repayment of principal pursuant to this
SECTION 2.5 shall be applied to prepay the outstanding Loans, pro rata, and
shall be accompanied by accrued and unpaid interest thereon.

          2.6   MANDATORY PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS. On any day on which the aggregate
outstanding principal of the Loans exceeds the Borrowing Base or the Aggregate
Commitment, such excess shall be immediately due and payable without the
necessity of any notice or demand. Repayment of such excess amounts shall be
applied to prepay the outstanding Loans, pro rata, and shall be accompanied by
accrued and unpaid interest thereon.

          2.7   ADJUSTMENTS OF COMMITMENTS.

          2.7.1   ADJUSTMENTS BY THE COMPANY. The Company may permanently reduce
the Aggregate Commitment, in whole or in part ratably among the Banks, in
proportion to the amounts of their respective Commitments in integral multiples
of $1,000,000, upon at least ten Business Days' written notice to the Banks,
which shall specify the amount of any such reduction; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that,
subject to SECTIONS 2.7.2, 11.9(b) and 11.9(c), the amount of the Aggregate
Commitment may not be reduced below the outstanding principal amount of the
Advance(s), and provided further that a reduction by the Company of the
Aggregate Commitment to zero shall terminate this Agreement as of the effective
date of such reduction. All accrued and unpaid commitment fees shall be payable
on the effective date of such termination.

          2.7.2   ADJUSTMENTS BY BANKS FOR ACCELERATED TERMINATION. If the

                                       11
<Page>

Commitment of a Bank hereunder is terminated pursuant to SECTION 11.9(b) or
11.9(c), the Company shall immediately notify each remaining Bank
("NON-TERMINATING BANK"), in writing of such termination ("ACCELERATED
TERMINATION NOTICE") and shall state the amount of such terminating Bank's
Commitment ("TERMINATED COMMITMENT") in the Accelerated Termination Notice. Each
Non-Terminating Bank shall notify the Company, in writing, on or before the 5th
Business Day after the date of the Accelerated Termination Notice, if and by
what amount such Bank is willing to increase its Commitment, which amount shall
be equal to all or some portion of the Terminated Commitment (each, a "2.7.2
NOTICE"). Any Non-Terminating Bank that fails to so notify the Company on or
before such 5th Business Day, shall be deemed to have declined to increase its
Commitment. If offers to increase Commitments are made by two or more
Non-Terminating Banks in an aggregate amount greater than the aggregate amount
of the Terminated Commitment, such Non-Terminating Banks and the Company hereby
agree that such offers shall be allocated as nearly as possible in proportion to
the aggregate amount of such offers, so that the aggregate amount thereof will
not exceed the amount of the Terminated Commitment. On or before the 6th
Business Day after the date of the Accelerated Termination Notice, the Company
shall notify each Non-Terminating Bank of the amount by which each such
Non-Terminating Bank's Commitment has been increased, which amount shall not
exceed the amount of such Non-Terminating Bank's offer to increase its
Commitment in such Bank's 2.7.2 Notice. All increases of Commitments by the
Banks, under this SECTION 2.7.2 shall become effective on the terminating Bank's
Accelerated Termination Date ("2.7.2 EFFECTIVE DATE"). The Company shall
promptly, and in no event later than the 2.7.2 Effective Date, deliver to each
Bank whose Commitment has been increased pursuant to this SECTION 2.7.2 a new
Note reflecting such Bank's new Commitment amount and each such Bank shall
promptly, after repayment of all Advances outstanding on the 2.7.2 Effective
Date, return to the Company the Company's superseded Note. On the 2.7.2
Effective Date, the Commitments shall be adjusted to reflect any such increases.

           2.8   COMMITMENT FEE. From the date hereof to and including the
Revolving Credit Termination Date, the Company agrees to pay to each Bank a
commitment fee of 8/100 of 1% per annum (on the basis of a year consisting of
360 days) on the daily amount of such Bank's ratable share (determined in
proportion to its respective Commitment) of the excess of (i) the amount of the
Aggregate Commitment over (ii) the aggregate principal amount of all outstanding
Advances of the Banks, payable on the last day of each November, February, May
and August hereafter and on the Revolving Credit Termination Date, commencing on
the first of such dates to occur after the date hereof.

          2.9   COLLATERAL.

Agreement with another security of a type described in CME Rule 816 that has a
market value equal to or greater than the market value of the replaced security,
determined as of the date of replacement by the Collateral Agent in accordance
with its usual and customary practices.

          (c) So long as no Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the
Company may from time to time direct the Collateral Agent to (and the Collateral
Agent shall upon the request of the Company) liquidate any securities credited
to the Securities Account and any Money Fund Shares and apply the proceeds
thereof and any other amounts credited to the Securities Account to repay any
outstanding Loans, provided that after giving effect to such liquidation and the
repayment of such Loans, the aggregate principal amount of all remaining Loans
outstanding as of the date of such removal shall not exceed the Borrowing Base
as of the date of such removal.

          (d) Upon any replacement or liquidation of Collateral pursuant to
subsection (b) or (c) above, the Lien of the Collateral Agent on the replaced or
liquidated Collateral, as applicable, shall be deemed released without further
consent of the Collateral Agent or any Bank.

                                  ARTICLE III

                               FUNDING THE CREDITS

          3.1 METHOD OF BORROWING. The Company shall give the Collateral Agent,

event, not later than 3:45 p.m. (Chicago time), provide each Bank with a

precedent set forth in Article V, not later than 4:45 p.m. (Chicago time) on

                                       13
<Page>

severally shall make available to the Company, its pro rata share of the full

p.m. (Chicago time) on each Borrowing Date, each Servicing Bank shall make
available to the Company, on behalf of the Bank or Banks that it services, such
serviced Bank's or Banks' pro rata share of the full amount of each Advance in
immediately available funds, at such Servicing Bank's address specified pursuant
to Article XIII.

          3.2 MINIMUM AMOUNT OF EACH ADVANCE. Each Advance shall be in the
minimum amount of $10,000,000 (and in integral multiples of $250,000 if in
excess thereof), PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that any Advance may be in the aggregate
amount of the Excess Availability.

          3.3 RATE BEFORE AND AFTER MATURITY. Prior to maturity, Advances shall
bear interest at the Fed Funds Rate plus 45/100 of 1% per annum. Any Advance not
paid at maturity, whether by acceleration or otherwise, shall bear interest
until paid in full at a rate per annum equal to the Fed Funds Rate plus 2.4% per
annum. In the event that a change in the Fed Funds Rate is announced or
published at the time a Loan is outstanding, such change shall become effective
at the time it is announced or published.

          3.4 METHOD OF PAYMENT. All payments (including prepayments) of
principal, interest, commitment fees and other amounts payable hereunder by the
Company shall be made in immediately available funds to the Banks (or, if
applicable, the related Servicing Banks) at the addresses specified pursuant to
Article XIII. All such payments shall be applied to principal, interest, fees,
expenses and other amounts due and payable hereunder in the following order:
FIRST, to amounts payable hereunder other than principal, interest and
commitment fees; SECOND, to commitment fees (in chronological order in
accordance with the dates such fees became due and payable); and THIRD, to
principal of, and interest on, the Advances (in chronological order in
accordance with the dates such Advances were made; and as to any single Advance,
first to interest thereon and second to principal thereof). Subject to the
provisions of SECTION 4.4, (a) all payments of principal of, and interest on,
the Advances shall be made to the Banks (or, if applicable, the related
Servicing Banks) ratably among the Banks, in proportion to the outstanding
principal amount of their respective Loans constituting part of such Advance and
(b) all payments of commitment fees and other amounts payable hereunder to the
Banks shall be made to the Banks (or, if applicable, the related Servicing Banks
on behalf of the applicable Banks, if applicable) ratably among the Banks, in
proportion to the amounts of their respective Commitments on the date such
payment is made.

          3.5  NOTES; TELEPHONIC NOTICES. Each Bank shall maintain in accordance

<Page>

the Loans made by such Bank from time to time, including the amounts of
principal and interest payable and paid to such Bank from time to time under
this Agreement and the Notes; and each Bank is hereby authorized to record the
principal amount of each of its Loans and each repayment on the schedule
attached to its Note or in its books and records; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the
failure to so record shall not affect the Company's obligations under such Note.
The records kept by each Bank shall be presumed to be accurate and shall be
binding upon the Company absent manifest error. The Company hereby authorizes
the Banks and the Servicing Banks to extend Advances based on telephonic notices
made by any Persons any such Bank or Servicing Bank in good faith believes to be
acting on behalf of the Company. The Company agrees to deliver promptly to each
Bank and Servicing Bank a written confirmation of each telephonic notice signed
by an authorized signatory. If the written confirmation differs in any material
respect from the action taken by a Bank or Servicing Bank, as applicable, the
records of such Bank or Servicing Bank, as applicable, shall govern absent
manifest error.

          3.6   INTEREST PAYMENT DATES; INTEREST BASIS. Interest accrued on each
Advance prior to maturity shall be payable to Banks (or, if applicable, the
related Servicing Banks) on the date on which the Advance is paid or prepaid,
whether due to acceleration or otherwise. Interest accrued on each Advance after
maturity shall be payable on demand. Interest and commitment fees shall be
calculated for actual days elapsed on the basis of a 360-day year. Interest
shall be payable for the day an Advance is made but not for the day of any
payment on the amount paid if payment is received prior to noon (local time at
the place of payment). If any payment of principal of, or interest on, an
Advance shall become due on a day which is not a Business Day, such payment
shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day and, in the case of a
principal payment, such extension of time shall be included in computing
interest in connection with such payment.

                                   ARTICLE IV

                          BANKS' SERVICING ARRANGEMENT

          4.1 NOTICE TO AND PAYMENT BY THE BANKS. Promptly after receiving
notice from the Company of each Advance requested pursuant to SECTION 3.1, the
Servicing Banks shall notify each of the applicable Banks by telephone (which
may, at the option of the Servicing Banks, be accompanied by facsimile
transmission), of each Advance, which notice shall state: (a) the dollar amount
of such Advance; (b) each Bank's ratable share of such Advance; (c) the date and
time when such Advance is to be made; and (d) the Servicing Bank to which the
Bank's ratable share of such Advance shall be sent. Except as hereinafter
provided, promptly after receipt of such notice from the Servicing Banks and, in
any event, before the time specified in such

                                       15
<Page>

notice as the time when such Advance is to be made to the Company, each
applicable Bank shall transfer its ratable share of such Advance to the
appropriate Servicing Bank by Federal Reserve wire transfer or, in the event of
a failure of the Federal Reserve wire transfer system, in other immediately
available funds.

          4.2 PAYMENT BY BANKS TO SERVICING BANKS. If a Servicing Bank fails to
receive a transfer from any of the applicable Banks by the time required
pursuant to SECTION 4.1, such Servicing Bank shall advance such amount for and
on behalf of such Bank, provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing, such Bank
shall, in any event, transfer to the Servicing Bank, by the means set forth in
SECTION 4.1, its ratable share of the relevant Advance not later than 10:00 a.m.
(Chicago time) the next Business Day after the Servicing Bank provides such Bank
with the notice specified in SECTION 4.1. In the event a Servicing Bank advances
funds overnight to the Company pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence,
the Bank on whose behalf such funds are advanced shall reimburse the Servicing
Bank for the Servicing Bank's cost of overnight funds, for the period from the
time the Servicing Bank advances such funds to the Company for and on behalf of
such Bank to the time of the Servicing Bank's receipt of such Bank's transfer of
its ratable share of the relevant Advance. Such Servicing Bank shall promptly
provide such Bank with notice of the amount of its cost of overnight funds for
such period and such amount shall thereupon become immediately due and payable
from such Bank to such Servicing Bank, and shall be paid by such Bank to such
Servicing Bank upon receipt of such notice without further notice from or demand
by such Servicing Bank.

          4.3 DISTRIBUTION OF PAYMENTS. Whenever a Servicing Bank receives from,
or on behalf of the Company, or any other person or party, a payment of
principal, interest or commitment fees in connection with the Loans with respect
to any of which the applicable Banks are entitled to receive a share, such
Servicing Bank shall promptly pay to such Banks, in lawful money of the United
States of America and in the kind of funds so received by such Servicing Bank,
the amount due each of such Banks as determined pursuant to this Agreement;
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the amount of such distribution shall be adjusted to the
extent that amounts are owed by any Bank to such Servicing Bank pursuant to
SECTION 4.2. or are required to be returned to such Servicing Bank pursuant to
SECTION 4.4. If any payment of principal, interest or commitment fees is
received from or on behalf of the Company by a Servicing Bank before 10:00 a.m.
(Chicago time) on any Business Day, that Servicing Bank shall use reasonable
efforts to wire transfer the appropriate portion of the same to the applicable
Banks that same Business Day, but in any event shall wire the same to each of
such Banks before the end of the next Business Day. In the event that a
Servicing Bank receives any such payment from or on behalf of the Company before
10:00 a.m. (Chicago time) on any Business Day and does not transfer to one or
more of the applicable Banks the appropriate portion of such payment on that
day, the Company shall, promptly upon receipt of notice from any

                                       16

<Page>

such Bank, pay directly to such Bank an amount equal to the interest on such
portion, at the Fed Funds Rate or, with respect to any payment of principal on a
Loan, at the rate set forth in SECTION 3.3, for the period commencing on the day
such Servicing Bank receives such payment up to but not including the following
Business Day.

          4.4   RESCISSION OF PAYMENTS BY THE COMPANY. If all or part of any
payment made by the Company to a Servicing Bank of principal, interest or
commitment fees in connection with the Loans is rescinded or must otherwise be
returned for any reason and if a Servicing Bank has paid to any of the Banks
such Bank's ratable share therein, such Bank shall, upon telephone notice from
such Servicing Bank, forthwith pay to such Servicing Bank, on the date of such
telephone notice (if notice is received by such Servicing Bank at or prior to
10:00 a.m. Chicago time) or on the next Business Day (if notice is received by
such Servicing Bank after 10:00 a.m. Chicago time), an amount equal to such
Bank's ratable interest in the amount that was rescinded or that must be so
returned by the Servicing Bank. A Servicing Bank shall promptly return to the
Company each such amount (or any lesser amount) that is received from each Bank.
A Servicing Bank shall have no obligation to the Company for any amount that the
Servicing Bank paid to any Bank and that is not repaid by such Bank, provided
that the Servicing Bank did in fact provide such Bank with the notice described
above to the effect that such payment was rescinded or must be returned.

          4.5   POWERS GRANTED TO THE SERVICING BANKS. The Company and one or
more Banks (each a "PRINCIPAL BANK") may, upon mutual agreement, from time to
time request another Bank to act as a Servicing Bank for the purpose of
administering and servicing the Loans of the Principal Banks. Upon the
acceptance of the offer to service by the proposed Servicing Bank (which shall
be in the sole discretion of such Bank), such Servicing Bank as administrator of
the Loans of the Principal Banks for which it acts (and not as an agent,
employee or fiduciary), shall be entitled to exercise all such powers as are
incidental to the powers to receive and collect funds from the Principal Banks
and the Company provided for in this Agreement, and to take such other actions
with respect to such Loans as are provided hereby or as may be from time to time
agreed by such Servicing Bank and the Principal Banks. In acting under this
Agreement, each Servicing Bank agrees to exercise the same degree of care in
administering such Loans as it would use in managing its own loans; PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, that this sentence shall not make any Servicing Bank a fiduciary to any
Principal Bank. The Principal Banks and the Company hereby agree and acknowledge
that (i) in performing the duties provided for in this Agreement, the Servicing
Banks are acting solely for the benefit of the Principal Banks and are in no way
to be construed to be acting as agent for the Company; and (ii) the servicing
arrangement provided for herein is not intended to constitute, and shall not be
construed to establish, a partnership or joint venture

                                       17
<Page>

between the Servicing Banks and the Principal Banks, or between the Servicing
Banks and the Company.

          4.6   RESIGNATION OR TERMINATION OF SERVICING BANK. A Servicing Bank
may resign its position as such at any time upon thirty (30) day's prior notice
to the Company and the Principal Banks for which it acts, and the Company and
the applicable Principal Banks acting together may terminate a Servicing Bank's
role as such at any time upon thirty (30) day's prior notice to such Servicing
Bank. Subsequent to the effective date of such resignation or termination, the
resigned or terminated (as applicable) Servicing Bank shall have no further
obligations in that capacity under this Agreement, and unless and until a
successor servicing bank is appointed by the Company and the applicable
Principal Banks acting together, (i) the services performed by such Servicing
Bank hereunder shall be performed by the individual Principal Banks, and the
Company, each on its own behalf, and (ii) any payments or communications made by
the Company to such Servicing Bank hereunder shall be made directly to the
applicable individual Principal Banks.

          4.7   NON-RELIANCE REPRESENTATION. Each of the Banks acknowledges and
represents that it has, independently of and without reliance upon the Servicing
Banks, and based solely upon its own expertise (and the expertise of its agents
and independent advisors) and upon financial statements and other information
deemed appropriate by it, made its own credit analysis of the Company and made
its own decision to enter into this Agreement. Each of the Banks further
acknowledges and represents that it will, independently of and without reliance
upon the Servicing Banks, and based solely upon its own expertise (and the
expertise of its agents and independent advisors, if any) and upon such
documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to
make its own credit analysis of the Company and its own decisions with respect
to this Agreement.

          4.8   EXCULPATION. No Servicing Bank nor any of its shareholders,
directors, officers, employees or agents shall be liable to the Banks, or any of
them individually, for any obligation, undertaking, act or judgment of the
Company or any other Person, or for any error of judgment or any action taken or
omitted to be taken by such Servicing Banks or any other Servicing Bank (except
and to the extent that the same arises from gross negligence or willful
misconduct on the part of such Servicing Bank), or be bound to ascertain or
inquire as to the performance or observance of any term of any of the Loan
Documents. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Servicing
Banks: (a) may consult with legal counsel selected by the Servicing Banks and
shall not be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken in good faith by
the Servicing Banks in accordance with the advice of such counsel; (b) makes no
warranty or representation and shall not be responsible for any warranty or
representation made in or in connection with any of the Loan Documents, or for
the financial condition of the Company or any other

Person, or for the observance or performance of any obligations of the Company
or any other Person, or for the truth or accuracy of any document provided to
the Banks that the Servicing Banks have initially received from, or that the
Servicing Banks have prepared based upon information received from, the Company
or any other Person; (c) make no warranty or representation and shall not be
responsible for the due execution, validity, enforceability, sufficiency or
collectibility of any of the Loan Documents; (d) shall incur no liability under
or in respect of any such agreement or document by acting upon any notice (by
telephone or otherwise), or writing (including telex and telegraphic
communication) believed by the Servicing Banks in good faith to be genuine and
to be signed or sent by the proper party or Person; and (e) make no warranty or
guarantee as to: (i) future payments by the Company or any other obligor or
guarantor of the Loans, (ii) the Company's future compliance with or performance
of any of the terms and conditions contained in the Loan Documents, or (iii) the
collectibility of the Loans.

                                   ARTICLE VI

                         REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

           The Company represents and warrants to the Banks, as of the date of
each Advance, that:

          6.1 CORPORATE EXISTENCE AND STANDING. Each of the Company and the
Subsidiaries is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation and has all
requisite authority to conduct its business in each jurisdiction in which its
business is conducted and where the failure to have such authority would
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

          6.2 AUTHORIZATION AND VALIDITY.

            (a) The Company has the corporate power and authority and legal
right to execute and deliver the Loan Documents and to perform its obligations
thereunder. The execution and delivery by the Company of the Loan

                                       21
<Page>

Documents and the performance of its obligations thereunder have been duly
authorized by proper corporate proceedings. The Company has duly executed and
delivered the Loan Documents, and the Loan Documents constitute legal, valid and
binding obligations of the Company enforceable against the Company in accordance
with their terms, except as enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy,
insolvency or similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights
generally and by general principles of equity (whether enforcement is considered
in a proceeding at law or in equity).

            (b) The Company has the authority pursuant to CME Rule 816 to
execute and deliver, as Member Attorney-in-Fact on behalf of the applicable
Clearing Members, the Collateral Documents and to cause the Security Deposits to
be subject to the Lien of the Collateral Documents to secure the Obligations.
CME Rules 816 and 913.B have been duly adopted and are in full force and effect.

          6.3 COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS AND CONTRACTS. Neither the execution and
delivery by the Company of the Loan Documents, nor the consummation of the
transactions therein contemplated, nor compliance with the provisions thereof
will violate any law, rule, regulation, order, writ, judgment, injunction,
decree or award binding on the Company or any Subsidiary or the Company's or any
Subsidiary's articles of incorporation or by-laws or the provisions of any
material indenture, instrument or agreement to which the Company or any
Subsidiary is a party or is subject, or by which it, or its property, is bound,
or conflict with or constitute a default thereunder. No order, consent,
approval, license, authorization, or validation of, or filing, recording or
registration with, or exemption by, any governmental or public body or
authority, or any subdivision thereof, that has not been obtained is required to
authorize, or is required in connection with the execution, delivery and
performance of, or the legality, validity, binding effect or enforceability of,
any of the Loan Documents.

          6.4 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. The most recent annual, audited consolidated
financial statements of the Company and the Subsidiaries heretofore delivered to
the Banks were prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles in effect on the date such statements were prepared and fairly
present the consolidated financial condition and operations of the Company and
the Subsidiaries at such date and the consolidated results of their operations
for the period then ended.

          6.5 MATERIAL ADVERSE CHANGE. No material adverse change in the
business, financial condition, or results of operations of the Company and the
Subsidiaries has occurred since the date of the financial statements referred to
in SECTION 6.4; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that in the event the Company utilizes its
own funds

                                       22
<Page>

to repay all or any portion of an Advance, and such repayment results in such a
material adverse change, then such material adverse change shall not be deemed
to have occurred until the thirty-first consecutive day that such material
adverse change continues.

          6.6 SUBSIDIARIES. SCHEDULE I contains an accurate list of all of the
presently existing Subsidiaries of the Company, setting forth their respective
jurisdictions of incorporation and the percentage of their respective capital
stock owned by the Company or other Subsidiaries. All of the issued and
outstanding shares of capital stock of such Subsidiaries have been duly
authorized and issued and are fully paid and non-assessable.

          6.7 ACCURACY OF INFORMATION. No written information, exhibit or report
furnished by the Company or any Subsidiary to any Bank in connection with the
negotiation of the Loan Documents contained any material misstatement of fact or
omitted to state a material fact or any fact necessary to make the statements
contained therein not materially misleading in light of the circumstances
existing at the time furnished.

          6.8 MARGIN REGULATIONS. Margin stock (as defined in Regulation U)
constitutes less than 25% of those assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries
which are subject to any limitation on sale, pledge, or other restriction
hereunder. No proceeds of any Loans will be used to "purchase" or "carry" any
"margin stock" (each as defined in Regulation U), or for any purpose that
violates the provisions of Regulation T, U or X of the Board of Governors of the
Federal Reserve System as now and from time to time hereafter in effect.

          6.9 TAXES. The Company and its Subsidiaries have filed all United
States federal tax returns and all other tax returns which are required to be
filed by any of them and have paid all taxes due pursuant to said returns or
pursuant to any assessment received by the Company or any such Subsidiary,
except such taxes, if any, as are being contested in good faith. To the best of
the Company's knowledge, no tax liens have been filed and no claims are being
asserted with respect to any such taxes other than those taxes that are being
contested in good faith. The charges, accruals and reserves on the books of the
Company and its Subsidiaries in respect of any taxes or other governmental
charges are adequate.

          6.10 LITIGATION. Except as set forth in SCHEDULE II attached hereto,
there is no litigation or proceeding pending or, to the knowledge of any of
their officers, threatened against or affecting the Company or any Subsidiary of
the Company which might materially adversely affect the business, financial
condition or results of operations of the Company or the ability of the Company
to perform its obligations under the Loan Documents.

<Page>

          6.11 ERISA. No Plan has Unfunded Liabilities in excess of $1,000,000.
Each Plan complies in all material respects with all applicable requirements of
law and regulations, no Reportable Event has occurred with respect to any Plan,
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has withdrawn from any Plan or
initiated steps to do so, and no steps have been taken to terminate any Plan.

                                  ARTICLE VII

                                    COVENANTS

unaudited consolidated statements of income, changes in shareholder's equity and
cash flows from the beginning of such fiscal year to the end of such quarter,
each prepared in a manner consistent with the preparation of the Company's
year-end statements and in accordance with Agreement Accounting Principles.

            (c) Within 45 days after the close of each quarterly period, a

the financial statements required hereunder, a certificate signed by its

            (e) Within 120 days after the close of each fiscal year, a statement

chief financial officer of the Company or another managing director, or, in the
event there are no Unfunded Liabilities, a certificate signed by its managing
director & chief financial officer or another managing director to that effect.

            (f) As soon as possible and in any event within 10 days after the

action which the Company proposes to take with respect thereto.

            (g) Such other information (including non-financial information) as
any Bank may from time to time reasonably request.

          7.2 USE OF PROCEEDS. The Company will only use the proceeds of the
Advances to provide temporary liquidity in circumstances where CME is entitled
to use the Security Deposits of its Clearing Members as provided in the CME
Rules and in circumstances where a Money Gridlock Situation exists.
Additionally, the Company may use the proceeds of the Advances to fulfill its
obligations under the GFX(TM) Guaranty, PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the Company may
use the proceeds for such purposes only up to the amount of Surplus Funds on any
given day. The Company will not, nor will it permit any Subsidiary to, use any
of the proceeds of the Loans to "purchase" or "carry" any "margin stock" (each
as defined in Regulation U) or for any purpose that violates the provisions of
Regulation T, U or X of the Board of the Federal Reserve System as now and from
time to time hereafter in effect.

          7.3 NOTICE OF DEFAULT. The Company will, and will cause each
Subsidiary to, give prompt notice in writing to the Banks of the occurrence of

business, properties or affairs or the ability of the Company to repay the
Obligations.

          7.4 CONDUCT OF BUSINESS. The Company will, and will cause each
Subsidiary to, carry on and conduct its business in substantially the same
manner and in substantially the same fields of enterprise as it is presently
conducted and to do all things necessary to remain duly incorporated, validly
existing and in good standing as a domestic corporation in its jurisdiction of
incorporation and maintain all requisite authority to conduct its business in
each jurisdiction in which its business is conducted and where the failure to
have such authority would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect.

          7.5 COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS. The Company will, and will cause each
Subsidiary to, comply with all laws, rules, regulations, orders, writs,
judgments, injunctions, decrees or awards to which it may be subject, except

Material Adverse Effect.

affairs, finances and accounts of the Company and each Subsidiary (the foregoing
activities, an "AUDIT") with, and to be advised as to the same by, their
respective officers at such reasonable times and intervals as the Collateral

                 ACCELERATION, WAIVERS, AMENDMENTS AND REMEDIES

          9.1 ACCELERATION. If any Default described in SECTION 8.6 or 8.7

terminate and the Obligations shall immediately become due and payable without
any election or action on the part of any Bank. If any other Default occurs, the

whereupon such Obligations shall become immediately due and payable, without
presentment, demand, protest or notice of any kind, all of which the Company
hereby expressly waives. In addition, at any time after which the Obligations
have become due and payable and the obligations of the Banks to make Loans
hereunder have terminated in accordance with this Section 9.1, the Collateral
Agent may, with the consent of the Required Banks (or shall, upon the direction
of the Required Banks), enforce any and all rights and interest created under
the Collateral Documents or the UCC, including, without limitation, foreclosing
the security interests created pursuant to the Collateral Documents by any
available judicial procedure, and exercise all other rights and remedies of the
Collateral Agent otherwise available under any other provision of this
Agreement, by operation of

                                       29

law, at equity or otherwise, all of which are hereby expressly preserved and all
of which rights shall be cumulative.

          9.2 AMENDMENTS. Subject to the provisions of this Section, the
Required Banks and the Company may enter into agreements supplemental hereto for
the purpose of adding or modifying any provisions to the Loan Documents or
changing in any manner the rights of the Banks or the Company hereunder or
waiving any Default hereunder; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that:

          (a) the consent of the Company and all of the Banks shall be required
to (i) reduce the percentage specified in the definition of Required Banks, (ii)
reduce the principal amount of or extend the maturity date for any Advance or
reduce the rate or change the time of payment of interest thereon, (iii) reduce
the rate or change the time of payment of any commitment fee, (iv) adjust the
amount of the Commitment of any Bank except as otherwise permitted herein, (v)
amend SECTION 2.7, 2.8, 5.2 or this SECTION 9.2, (vi) extend the Revolving
Credit Termination Date, (vii) permit the Company to assign its rights under
this Agreement, (viii) amend the definition of "Borrowing Base" or (ix) release
any of the Collateral from the Lien granted pursuant to the Collateral Documents
other than as permitted by this Agreement or any other Loan Document; and

          (b) the Company may add a new Bank(s) under the terms of this
Agreement, PROVIDED, HOWEVER, the Aggregate Commitment shall not exceed the
Borrowing Base at such time and each such new Bank shall agree in writing to be
bound by the terms of this Agreement.

          9.3 PRESERVATION OF RIGHTS. No delay or omission of the Banks to
exercise any right under the Loan Documents shall impair such right or be
construed to be a waiver of any Default or an acquiescence therein, and the
making of a Loan notwithstanding the existence of a Default or the inability of
the Company to satisfy the conditions precedent to such Loan shall not
constitute any waiver or acquiescence. Any single or partial exercise of any
such right shall not preclude other or further exercise thereof or the exercise
of any other right, and no waiver, amendment or other variation of the terms,
conditions or provisions of the Loan Documents whatsoever shall be valid unless
in writing signed by the Banks required pursuant to SECTION 9.2, and then only
to the extent in such writing specifically set forth. All remedies contained in
the Loan Documents or by law afforded shall be cumulative and all shall be
available to the Banks until the Obligations have been paid in full and the
Commitments have been terminated.

                                   ARTICLE X

                                COLLATERAL AGENT

          10.1 DECLARATION AND ACCEPTANCE OF APPOINTMENT; NO FIDUCIARY DUTIES.
Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, each Bank hereby appoints and
authorizes The Bank of New York to act as its collateral agent hereunder and
under each of the Collateral Documents and other Loan Documents, with such
powers as are expressly delegated to the Collateral Agent by the terms of this
Agreement, the Collateral Documents, and the other Loan Documents, together with
such other powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. The Bank of New York, by
its execution hereof, hereby accepts the appointment made under this SECTION
10.1. The Collateral Agent shall not have any duties or responsibilities except
those expressly set forth in this Agreement, the Collateral Documents and the
other Loan Documents, or be a trustee for, or have any fiduciary obligation to,
any Bank, and no implied covenants, functions, responsibilities, duties,
obligations or liabilities on the part of the Collateral Agent shall be read
into this Agreement or any other Loan Document or otherwise exist for the
Collateral Agent. In performing its functions and duties hereunder and under the
other Loan Documents, the Collateral Agent shall act solely as agent for the
Banks and does not assume nor shall be deemed to have assumed any obligation or
relationship of trust or agency with or for the Company or any of its successors
or assigns. The Collateral Agent shall not be required to take any action that
exposes the Collateral Agent to personal liability or that is contrary to this
Agreement, any other Loan Document or applicable law. The appointment and
authority of the Collateral Agent hereunder shall terminate upon the
indefeasible payment in full of all Obligations and the termination of the
Commitments. Each Bank hereby authorizes the Collateral Agent to execute each of
the Collateral Documents on behalf of such Bank (the terms of which shall be
binding on such Bank).

          10.2 RELIANCE BY COLLATERAL AGENT. The Collateral Agent shall in all
cases be entitled to rely, and shall be fully protected in relying, upon any
document or conversation believed by it in good faith to be genuine and correct
and to have been signed, sent or made by the proper Person or Persons and upon
advice and statements of legal counsel (including, without limitation, counsel
to the Company), independent accountants and other experts selected by the
Collateral Agent and acceptable to the Required Banks. The Collateral Agent
shall in all cases be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any action
under this Agreement or any other Loan Document unless it shall first receive
such advice or concurrence of the Company or the Required Banks (or, if
required, all of the Banks), as applicable, as it deems appropriate and it shall
first be indemnified to its satisfaction by the Banks, provided that unless and
until the Collateral Agent shall have received such advice, the Collateral Agent
may take or refrain from taking any action, as the Collateral


                                       31
<Page>

Agent shall deem advisable and in the best interests of the Banks. The
Collateral Agent shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in
refraining from acting, in accordance with a request of the Company or the
Required Banks or all of the Banks, as applicable, and such request and any
action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding upon all the
Banks.

          10.3 REIMBURSEMENT AND INDEMNIFICATION. The Banks severally agree to
reimburse and indemnify the Collateral Agent and its officers, directors,
employees, representatives and agents ratably in proportion to the amounts of
their respective Commitments, to the extent not paid or reimbursed by the
Company (i) for any amounts for which the Collateral Agent, acting in its
capacity as Collateral Agent, is entitled to reimbursement by the Company
hereunder or under any other Loan Document and (ii) for any other actual
out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Collateral Agent, in its capacity as
Collateral Agent and acting on behalf of the Banks, in connection with the
administration and enforcement of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents,
except in each case, for any amounts or expenses that arise as a result of the
gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Collateral Agent.

          10.4 COLLATERAL AGENT IN ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY. The Collateral Agent
and its affiliates may make loans to, accept deposits from and generally engage
in any kind of business with the Company or any affiliate of the Company as
though the Collateral Agent were not the Collateral Agent hereunder. With
respect to the making of Loans pursuant to this Agreement, the Collateral Agent
shall have the same rights and powers under this Agreement in its individual
capacity as any Bank and may exercise the same as though it were not the
Collateral Agent, and the terms "Bank," and "Banks" shall include the Collateral
Agent in its individual capacity.

          10.5 RESIGNATION OR TERMINATION OF COLLATERAL AGENT. The Collateral
Agent may resign its position as such at any time upon ninety (90) days' prior
notice to the Company and the Banks. The Collateral Agent may be terminated by
100% of the Banks (excluding any Bank then acting as Collateral Agent) at any
time upon thirty (30) days' prior notice to the Company, the Collateral Agent
and the other Banks. The Required Banks, with the consent of the Company (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld), shall appoint a successor Collateral
Agent to succeed any Collateral Agent that resigns or its terminated pursuant to
this SECTION 10.5. Subsequent to the effective date of such resignation or
termination, the resigning or terminated (as applicable) Collateral Agent shall
have no further obligations in that capacity under this Agreement. If no
successor Collateral Agent shall have been appointed by the Company and the
Required Banks and shall have accepted such appointment prior to the effective
date of the resignation or termination of the then acting Collateral Agent, the
resigning or terminated Collateral Agent may appoint a successor Collateral
Agent, which shall be a bank or

                                       32
<Page>

trust company organized under the laws of the United States of America or any
State thereof, having a combined capital and surplus of at least $500,000,000.

          10.6 NON-RELIANCE REPRESENTATION. Each of the Banks acknowledges and
represents that it has, independently of and without reliance upon the
Collateral Agent, and based solely upon its own expertise (and the expertise of
its agents and independent advisors) and upon financial statements and other
information deemed appropriate by it, made its own credit analysis of the
Company and made its own decision to enter into this Agreement. Each of the
Banks further acknowledges and represents that it will, independently of and
without reliance upon the Collateral Agent, and based solely upon its own
expertise (and the expertise of its agents and independent advisors, if any) and
upon such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time,
continue to make its own credit analysis of the Company and its own decisions
with respect to this Agreement.

          10.7 EXCULPATION. Neither the Collateral Agent nor any of its
shareholders, directors, officers, employees or agents shall be liable to the
Banks, or any of them individually, for any obligation, undertaking, act or
judgment of the Company or any other Person, or for any error of judgment or any
action taken or omitted to be taken by the Collateral Agent (except and to the
extent that the same arises from gross negligence or willful misconduct on the
part of the Collateral Agent), or be bound to ascertain or inquire as to the
performance or observance of any term of any of the Loan Documents. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Collateral Agent: (a) may consult
with legal counsel selected by it and shall not be liable for any action taken
or omitted to be taken in good faith by it in accordance with the advice of such
counsel; (b) makes no warranty or representation and shall not be responsible
for any warranty or representation made in or in connection with any of the Loan
Documents by any Person other than the Collateral Agent, or for the financial
condition of the Company or any other Person, or for the observance or
performance of any obligations of the Company or any other Person other than the
Collateral Agent, or for the truth or accuracy of any document provided to the
Collateral Agent that the Collateral Agent has initially received from, or that
the Collateral Agent has prepared based upon information received from, the
Company or any other Person, except for the Collateral Agent's responsibility
under SECTION 10.8; (c) makes no warranty or representation and shall not be
responsible for the due execution, validity, enforceability, sufficiency or
collectibility of any of the Loan Documents; (d) shall incur no liability under
or in respect of any such agreement or document by acting upon any notice (by
telephone or otherwise), or writing (including telex and telegraphic
communication) believed by it in good faith to be genuine and to be signed or
sent by the proper party or Person; and (e) makes no warranty or guarantee as
to: (i) future payments by the Company or any other obligor or guarantor of the
Loans, (ii) the Company's future compliance with or

                                       33
<Page>

performance of any of the terms and conditions contained in the Loan Documents,
or (iii) the collectibility of the Loans.

          10.8 COLLATERAL VALUATION. The Collateral Agent shall monitor the
market value of the Collateral. On each Borrowing Date, promptly after receiving
notice from the Company of a proposed borrowing, and on the last day of each
calendar month (or, if such day is not a Business Day, the next succeeding
Business Day), commencing with the first such date to occur after the date
hereof, the Collateral Agent shall determine the aggregate market value of all
Collateral on and as of such date in accordance with its usual and customary
practices and shall advise and notify (which may be by telephone) each Bank
thereof (each a, "COLLATERAL NOTICE").

                                   ARTICLE XI

                               GENERAL PROVISIONS

          11.1 SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS.

            (a) The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure
to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and
assigns, except that the Company may not assign or otherwise transfer any of its
rights under this Agreement.

            (b) Any Bank may, in accordance with applicable law, at any time
sell to one or more banks, financial institutions or other entities
("PARTICIPANTS") participating interests in any Loan owing to such Bank, any
Note held by such Bank, any Commitment of such Bank or any other interest of
such Bank hereunder. In the event of any such sale by a Bank of participating
interests to a Participant, such Bank's obligations under this Agreement to the
other parties to this Agreement shall remain unchanged, such Bank shall remain
solely responsible for the performance thereof and the Company and the
Collateral Agent shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Bank in
connection with such Bank's rights and obligations under this Agreement and the
other Loan Documents. In no event shall a Bank that sells a participating
interest be obligated to the Participant to take or refrain from taking any
action hereunder or under any of the other Loan Documents except that such Bank
may agree that it will not, without the consent of such Participant, agree to
(A) reduce the principal of, or interest payable on (or reduce the rate of
interest applicable to), the Loans of such Bank or any fees or other amounts
payable to such Bank hereunder which, in each case, are related to the
participation sold to such Participant or, (B) postpone the date fixed for any

                                       34
<Page>

payment of the principal of, or interest on, the Loans of such Bank or other
amounts payable to such Bank hereunder which, in each case, are related to the
participation sold to such Participant.

          (c) Any Bank may (or in accordance with SECTION 11.4(h) shall), in
accordance with applicable law, and with the consent of the Company (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld), at any time sell to any financial
institution (all such purchasers, collectively, "PURCHASERS") all or any part of
its rights and obligations under this Agreement and the Note held by it pursuant
to an assignment agreement (an "ASSIGNMENT AGREEMENT"), executed by such
Purchaser and such Bank and delivered to the Company and the Collateral Agent;
provided that the consent of the Company to any such assignment shall not be
required if (A) an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, (B) the
assignment is by a Bank to an Affiliate of such Bank or another existing Bank or
(C) the assignment (including any pledge) is by any Bank of its Notes and its
rights hereunder with respect thereto to any Federal Reserve Bank. Upon such
execution and delivery of an Assignment Agreement, from and after the effective
date as specified therein, (x) the Purchaser thereunder shall be a party hereto
and shall be bound by the provisions hereto and, to the extent provided in such
Assignment Agreement, shall have the rights and obligations of a Bank hereunder,
with its Commitment as set forth in such Assignment Agreement, and (y) the
transferor Bank thereunder shall, to the extent provided in such Assignment
Agreement, be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the
case of an Assignment Agreement covering all or the remaining portion of a
transferor Bank's rights and obligations under this Agreement, such transferor
Bank shall cease to be a party hereto). Upon delivery of the Assignment
Agreement to the Company and the Collateral Agent, the Company, the Collateral
Agent and the Banks may treat the Purchaser as the owner of the Loans recorded
therein for all purposes of this Agreement.

          (d) On the effective date specified in any Assignment Agreement, or as
soon as possible thereafter, the Company shall execute and deliver to the
transferor Bank in exchange for the Note held by the transferor Bank (which
existing Note shall be surrendered to the Company), a new Note to the order of
such Purchaser reflecting the Commitment and outstanding Loans obtained by it
pursuant to such Assignment Agreement and, if the transferor Bank has retained a
Commitment and Loans hereunder, a new Note to the order of the transferor Bank
reflecting the Commitment and outstanding Loans retained by it hereunder. Such
new Notes shall be dated the Transfer Effective Date and shall otherwise be in
the form of the Note replaced thereby. The Note surrendered by the transferor
Bank shall be returned by the transferor Bank to the Company marked "canceled".

                                       35
<Page>

          (e) The Company authorizes each Bank to disclose to any Participant or
Purchaser and any prospective Participant or Purchaser any and all financial and
other information in such Bank's possession concerning the Company which has
been delivered to such Bank by or on behalf of the Company pursuant to this
Agreement; PROVIDED that such Participant or Purchaser or prospective
Participant or Purchaser agrees to be bound by the confidentiality provisions
contained in SECTION 11.14.

          (f) If, pursuant to this SECTION 11.1, any interest in this Agreement
or any Note is transferred to any Purchaser which is organized under the laws of
any jurisdiction other than the United States or any state thereof, such
Purchaser, concurrently with the effectiveness of such transfer and becoming a
party to this Agreement pursuant to the applicable Assignment Agreement shall,
(i) represent to the transferor Bank (for the benefit of the transferor Bank,
the Collateral Agent and the Company) that under applicable law and treaties
then in effect no United States federal taxes will be required to be withheld by
the Collateral Agent, the Company or the transferor Bank with respect to any
payments to be made to such Purchaser hereunder, (ii) furnish to the Company the
documentation described in SECTION 11.4(f), (wherein such Purchaser claims
entitlement to complete exemption from U.S. federal withholding tax on all
payments hereunder) and (iii) agree to otherwise comply with the terms of
SECTION 11.4(f).

          11.2 SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS. All representations and warranties
of the Company contained in this Agreement shall survive delivery of the Notes
and the making of the Loans herein contemplated.

          11.3 GOVERNMENTAL REGULATION. Anything contained in this Agreement to
the contrary notwithstanding, no Bank shall be obligated to extend credit to the
Company in violation of any limitation or prohibition provided by any applicable
statute or regulation.

          11.4 TAXES.

            (a) All payments to any Bank with respect to the Loans shall be made
free and clear of, and without deduction for any Indemnified Taxes or Other
Taxes; PROVIDED that if the Company shall be required to deduct any Indemnified
Taxes or Other Taxes from such payments, then (i) the sum payable shall be
increased by the amount (the "ADDITIONAL AMOUNT") necessary so that after making
all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums
described in this paragraph) such Bank receives an amount equal to the sum it
would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) the Company shall

                                       36


<Page>

make such deductions and (iii) the Company shall pay the full amount deducted to
the relevant governmental authority in accordance with applicable law. In
addition, to the extent not paid in accordance with the preceding sentence, the
Company shall pay any Other Taxes to the relevant governmental authority in
accordance with applicable law.

            (b) Subject to subsection (h) below, the Company shall indemnify
each Bank for Indemnified Taxes and Other Taxes paid by such Bank, PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, that the Company shall not be obligated to make payment to any Bank in
respect of penalties, interest and other similar liabilities attributable to
such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes if such penalties, interest or other
similar liabilities are attributable to the gross negligence or willful
misconduct of such Bank.

            (c) If a Bank shall become aware that it is entitled to claim a
refund from a governmental authority in respect of Indemnified Taxes or Other
Taxes paid by the Company pursuant to this SECTION 11.4, including Indemnified
Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by the Company, or with
respect to which the Company has paid Additional Amounts pursuant hereto, it
shall promptly notify the Company of the availability of such refund claim and,
if such Bank determines in good faith that making a claim for refund will not
have a material adverse effect on its taxes or business operations, shall,
within 30 days after receipt of a request by the Company, make a claim to such
governmental authority for such refund at the Company's expense. If a Bank
receives a refund in respect of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes paid by the
Company pursuant hereto, it shall within 30 days from the date of such receipt
pay over such refund to the Company (but only to the extent of Indemnified Taxes
or Other Taxes paid pursuant to hereto), including indemnity payments made or
Additional Amounts paid, by the Company under this SECTION 11.4 with respect to
the Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out
of pocket expenses of such Bank and without interest (other than interest paid
by the relevant governmental authority with respect to such refund).

          (d) If any Bank is or becomes eligible under any applicable law,
regulation, treaty or other rule to a reduced rate of taxation, or a complete
exemption from withholding, with respect to Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes on
payments made to it by the Company, such Bank shall, upon the request, and at
the cost and expense, of the Company, complete and deliver from time to time any
certificate, form or other document requested by the Company, the completion and
delivery of which are a precondition to obtaining the benefit of such reduced
rate or exemption, provided that the taking of such action by such Bank, would
not, in

                                       37
<Page>

the reasonable judgment of such Bank be disadvantageous or prejudicial to such
Bank or inconsistent with its internal policies or legal or regulatory
restrictions. For any period with respect to which a Bank has failed to provide
any such certificate, form or other document requested by the Company, such Bank
shall not be entitled to any payment under this SECTION 11.4 in respect of any
Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes that would not have been imposed but for such
failure.

          (e) Each Bank organized under the laws of a jurisdiction in the United
States, any State thereof or the District of Columbia (other than Banks that are
corporations or otherwise exempt from United States backup withholding Tax)
shall (i) deliver to the Company, upon execution hereof (or, with respect to
Persons becoming Banks hereunder by assignment, upon execution of the relevant
assignment agreement), two original copies of United States Internal Revenue
Form W-9 or any successor form, properly completed and duly executed by such
Bank, certifying that such Bank is exempt from United States backup withholding
Tax on payments of interest made under the Loan Documents and (ii) thereafter,
at each time it is so reasonably requested in writing by the Company, deliver
within a reasonable time two original copies of an updated Form W-9 or any
successor form thereto.

            (f) Each Bank that is organized under the laws of a jurisdiction
other than the United States, any State thereof or the District of Columbia
(each such Bank, a "FOREIGN BANK") that is entitled to an exemption from or
reduction of withholding Tax under the laws of the jurisdiction in which the
Company is located, or any treaty to which such jurisdiction is a party, with
respect to payments under the Loan Documents shall deliver to the Company, upon
execution hereof (or, with respect to Persons becoming Banks hereunder by
assignment, upon execution of the relevant assignment agreement), such properly
completed and duly executed documentation prescribed by applicable law or
reasonably requested by the Company as will permit such payments to be made
without withholding or at a reduced rate, unless in the good faith opinion of
the Foreign Bank such documentation would expose the Foreign Bank to any
material adverse consequences or risk. Such documentation shall be delivered by
each Foreign Bank on or before the date it becomes a Bank and on or before the
date, if any, such Foreign Bank changes its applicable lending office by
designating a different lending office with respect to its Loans (a "NEW LENDING
OFFICE"). In addition, each Foreign Bank shall deliver such forms promptly upon
the obsolescence or invalidity of any form previously delivered by such Foreign
Bank. Each Bank (and, in the case of a Foreign Bank, its lending office),
represents that on the date hereof, payments made hereunder by the Company to it
would not be subject to United States Federal withholding tax.

                                       38
<Page>

            (g) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a) and (b) above,
the Company shall not be required to indemnify any Foreign Bank, or to pay any
Additional Amounts to any Foreign Bank, in respect of United States Federal
withholding tax pursuant to subsection (a) or (b) above, (A) to the extent that
the obligation to withhold amounts with respect to United States Federal
withholding tax existed on the date such Foreign Bank became a Bank; (B) with
respect to payments to a New Lending Office with respect to a Loan, but only to
the extent that such withholding tax exceeds any withholding tax that would have
been imposed on such Bank had it not designated such New Lending Office; (C)
with respect to a change by such Foreign Bank of the jurisdiction in which it is
organized, incorporated, controlled or managed, or in which it is doing
business, from the date such Foreign Bank changed such jurisdiction, but only to
the extent that such withholding tax exceeds any withholding tax that would have
been imposed on such Bank had it not changed the jurisdiction in which it is
organized, incorporated, controlled or managed, or in which it is doing
business; or (D) to the extent that the obligation to pay such indemnity payment
or Additional Amounts would not have arisen but for a failure by such Foreign
Bank to comply with the provisions of SECTION 11.4(f).

            (h) If any Bank requests compensation under this SECTION 11.4, or if
the Company is required to pay any additional amount to any governmental
authority for the account of any Bank pursuant to this SECTION 11.4, then such
Bank shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for
funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations
hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates with the object of
avoiding or eliminating the amounts payable pursuant to this SECTION 11.4,
provided that such designation or assignment shall be on such terms that such
Bank and its lending office, in such Bank's sole judgment, suffer no economic,
legal, regulatory or other disadvantage and would not otherwise be
disadvantageous to such Bank. The Company hereby agrees to pay all reasonable
costs and expenses incurred by any Bank in connection with any such designation
or assignment.

If Bank requests compensation under this SECTION 11.4, or if the Company is
required to pay any additional amount to any governmental authority for the
account of any Bank pursuant to this SECTION 11.4, then the Company may, at its
sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Bank, require such Bank to assign
and delegate, without recourse, in accordance with and subject to the
restrictions contained in SECTION 11.1, all of such Bank's interests, rights and
obligations under this Agreement to one or more assignees that shall assume such
obligations (which assignee or assignees may be one or more other Banks);
PROVIDED, that (i) such Bank shall have received payment of an amount equal to
the outstanding principal of its Loans, accrued and unpaid interest thereon,
accrued and unpaid fees and all other

                                       39
<Page>

amounts payable to it hereunder from the assignee (to the extent of such
outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Company (in the case
of all other amounts) and (ii) such assignment will result in a reduction in
such compensation or payments. A Bank shall not be required to make any such
assignment and delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such
Bank or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Company to require such
assignment and delegation cease to apply.

A certificate of the relevant Bank setting forth the basis for any amounts (and
the calculation thereof and methodology in calculating, each in reasonable
detail) claimed under this SECTION 11.4 shall be delivered to the Company and
shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Failure or delay on the part of a
Bank to demand compensation of any amount under this Section shall not
constitute a waiver of such Bank's right to demand such compensation; PROVIDED
that the Company shall not be required to compensate any such Bank for any
amounts claimed under this Section that are incurred more than 90 days prior to
the date that such Bank notifies the Company of the circumstances giving rise to
such amounts and such Bank's intention to claim compensation therefor; provided,
further, that if the circumstances giving rise to such amounts have retroactive
effect, then the 90-day period referred to above shall be extended to include
the period of retroactive effect thereof.

            (i) Any payment required to be made by the Company to any Bank under
this SECTION 11.4 shall be deemed an Obligation and be secured by the
Collateral.


          11.5 CHOICE OF LAW; JURISDICTION. The Loan Documents (other than those
containing a contrary express choice of law provision) shall be construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of Illinois (excluding choice-of-law
principles of the law of such State that would require the application of the
laws of a jurisdiction other than such State), but giving effect to federal laws
applicable to national banks. The Company and the Banks hereby irrevocably
submit to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of any United States federal or
Illinois state court sitting in Chicago in any action or proceedings arising out
of or relating to any Loan Documents and the Company and the Banks hereby
irrevocably agree that all claims in respect of such action or proceeding may be
heard and determined in any such court.

          11.6 HEADINGS. Section headings in the Loan Documents are for
convenience of reference only, and shall not govern the interpretation of any of
the provisions of the Loan Documents.

          11.7 ENTIRE AGREEMENT. The Loan Documents embody the entire agreement
and understanding among the Company and the Banks and supersede all prior
agreements and understandings among the Company and the Banks relating to the
subject matter thereof, including the Existing Agreement.

          11.8 SEVERAL OBLIGATIONS. The respective obligations of the Banks
hereunder are several and not joint and no Bank shall be the partner or agent of
any other. The failure of any Bank to perform any of its obligations hereunder
shall not relieve any other Bank from any of its obligations hereunder.

          11.9 EXPENSES; INDEMNIFICATION.

            (a) The Company shall reimburse the Collateral Agent and each Bank
for any reasonable costs, internal charges and out-of-pocket expenses (including
attorneys' fees and time charges of attorneys, which attorneys may be employees
of the Collateral Agent or such Bank, as applicable) paid or incurred by the
Collateral Agent or such Bank, as applicable, in connection with the collection,
liquidation and enforcement of the Loan Documents and/or the Collateral. The
Company further agrees to indemnify the Collateral Agent, each Bank and their
respective directors, officers and employees (each an "INDEMNIFIED PARTY")
against all losses, claims, damages, penalties, judgments, liabilities and
expenses (including, without limitation, all expenses of litigation or
preparation therefor) which any of them may pay or incur arising out of or
relating to this Agreement, the other Loan Documents, the transactions
contemplated hereby or the direct or indirect application or proposed
application of the proceeds of any Loan hereunder (all of the foregoing being
collectively referred to as "INDEMNIFIED AMOUNTS"), excluding, however, in all
of the foregoing instances, Indemnified Amounts arising from the gross
negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the Indemnified Party seeking
indemnification and Indemnified Amounts consisting of taxes imposed on or
measured by the overall net income of the Indemnified Party seeking
indemnification.

            (b) If, after the date hereof, any law or any governmental rule,
regulation, policy, guideline or directive (whether or not having the force of
law) is adopted, or there is any change in the interpretation thereof, or the
compliance of any Bank with such, which, in any case, affects the amount of
capital required or expected to be maintained by the Bank or any corporation
controlling any Bank and any Bank reasonably determines the amount of capital
required is increased by or based upon the existence of this Agreement or its
Commitment hereunder, then, the Bank shall notify the Company of such fact and
shall provide a reasonably detailed description of such increased costs in the
notice ("INCREASED COST NOTICE"), together with documentation from the relevant
regulatory body setting forth such increased capital requirement, and within 15
days of the Company's receipt of such Increased

                                       41
<Page>

Cost Notice, the Company shall, in its sole discretion, determine whether to
terminate such Bank's Commitment and obligation to make Loans hereunder, or to
attempt to negotiate with such Bank a revised commitment fee (which revision
shall not constitute an amendment to SECTION 2.8 hereof for the purposes of
SECTION 9.2) and any other reimbursements provided for hereunder which reflect
the Bank's increased costs. In the event that the Company determines to
terminate such Bank's Commitment and obligation to make Loans hereunder, the
Company shall send written notice to the Bank within 15 days of the Company's
receipt of the Increased Cost Notice specifying a date at least 30 days
thereafter on which the Bank's Commitment and obligation to make Loans hereunder
shall be terminated. In the event that the Company determines to attempt to
negotiate with such Bank a revised commitment fee and other reimbursements, and
the Company and the Bank are unable to agree, within 30 days of the date of the
Increased Cost Notice, upon such revised fees and other reimbursements, the Bank
may send written notice to the Company, or the Company may send written notice
to the Bank specifying a date at least 30 days thereafter on which the Bank's
Commitment and obligation to make Loans hereunder shall be terminated. Any
payment required to be made by the Company under this SECTION 11.9(b) shall be
deemed an Obligation and be secured by the Collateral.

            (c) At least 45 days prior to the proposed consummation date of any
merger or consolidation of the Company with or into any other Person in which
the Company shall not be the surviving entity (such transaction, a
"RESTRUCTURING"), the Company will give written notice thereof to each Bank (a
"RESTRUCTURING NOTICE"), which notice shall set forth the material terms and
conditions of such Restructuring, including the identity of the surviving entity
of such Restructuring (the "SURVIVOR"). Upon receipt of a Restructuring Notice,
a Bank may elect, in its sole discretion, to terminate its Commitment hereunder
by notifying the Company thereof, which may be by telephone (a "TERMINATION
NOTICE") within 15 days of such Bank's receipt of the Restructuring Notice,
which termination shall become effective no sooner than 30 days after the
Company's receipt of the Termination Notice. Any Bank that fails to deliver a
Termination Notice within 15 days after its receipt of a Restructuring Notice
shall be deemed to have elected to terminate its Commitment.

            (d) The effective date of any termination of a Bank's Commitment
hereunder pursuant to subsection (b) or (c) above is referred to herein as the
"ACCELERATED TERMINATION DATE". Any such termination shall not accelerate the
maturity of any Loans outstanding to such Bank; commitment fees to such Bank
shall cease to accrue as of the Accelerated Termination Date; and the Company
shall be responsible for any and all Obligations and accrued and unpaid costs
(including increased costs), fees and expenses incurred with respect to such
Bank prior to the

                                       42
<Page>

Accelerated Termination Date. The obligations of the Company under this SECTION
11.9 shall survive the termination of this Agreement.

          11.10 ACCOUNTING. Except as provided to the contrary herein, all
accounting terms used herein shall be interpreted and all accounting
determinations hereunder shall be made in accordance with Agreement Accounting
Principles.

          11.11 SEVERABILITY OF PROVISIONS. Any provision in any Loan Document
that is held to be inoperative, unenforceable, or invalid in any jurisdiction
shall, as to that jurisdiction, be inoperative, unenforceable, or invalid
without affecting the remaining provisions in that jurisdiction or the
operation, enforceability, or validity of that provision in any other
jurisdiction, and to this end the provisions of all Loan Documents are declared
to be severable.

          11.12 PARENT HOLDING COMPANY. The Banks acknowledge that: (i) a
corporation, CME Holdings, Inc. ("HOLDINGS"), is currently being organized under
the laws of the State of Delaware, (ii) upon consummation of such organization
all of the capital stock of the Company currently held by its shareholders will
be transferred to Holdings in exchange for share of the capital stock of
Holdings and (iii) upon consummation of such exchange, the Company will be a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Holdings.

          11.13 AMENDMENT AND RESTATEMENT.

            (a) The effect of this Agreement is to amend and restate the
Existing Agreement, and to the extent that any rights, benefits or provisions in
favor of any of the parties to the Existing Agreement existed in the Existing
Agreement and continue to exist in this Agreement without any written waiver of
any such rights, benefits or provisions prior to the date hereof, then such
rights, benefits or provisions are acknowledged to be and to continue to be
effective from and after the date of the Existing Agreement. This Agreement is
not a novation.

            (b) The parties hereto agree and acknowledge that any and all rights
and provisions under the Existing Agreement, which expressly survive any
termination of the Existing Agreement shall continue and survive the execution
and delivery of this Agreement.

          11.14 CONFIDENTIALITY. Each of the Banks and the Collateral Agent
agrees to maintain the confidentiality of the Company Information, except that
Company Information may be disclosed (a) to its Affiliates, directors, officers,
employees and agents, including accountants, legal counsel and other advisors
who have a need to know such information (it being understood that the Persons
to whom such disclosure is made will be informed of the confidential nature of
such Company

                                       43
<Page>

Information and agree to keep such Company Information confidential on terms
substantially similar to this SECTION 11.14), (b) to any governmental agency or
representative thereof, provided that prior to such disclosure, the disclosing
party shall, to the extent practicable, promptly inform the Company of such
potential disclosure, (c) to the extent required by applicable laws or
regulations or by any subpoena or similar legal process or to the extent
reasonably required in connection with any litigation relating to this Agreement
or the Collateral to which such Bank or the Collateral Agent, as applicable, is
a party, (d) subject to an agreement containing provisions substantially the
same as those described in this SECTION 11.14, to any Purchaser or Participant
or any prospective Purchaser or Participant, (e) with the consent of the Company
or (f) to the extent such Company Information becomes publicly available other
than as a result of a breach of its confidentiality obligations as described in
this SECTION 11.14.

          As used in this Section, "COMPANY INFORMATION" means all information
received from the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates relating to
the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates, or their businesses, other
than any such information that is available to the Collateral Agent or any Bank,
as applicable, on a non-confidential basis prior to disclosure by the Company.

          11.15 WAIVER OF TRIAL BY JURY. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE
LAW, EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT OF TRIAL BY
JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION
WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY MATTER ARISING HEREUNDER OR THEREUNDER.


                                  ARTICLE XII

                            SETOFF; RATABLE PAYMENTS

          12.1 SETOFF; RATABLE PAYMENTS.

            (a) In addition to, and without limitation of, any rights of the
Banks under applicable law, if the Company becomes insolvent, however evidenced,
or any Default occurs and is continuing, any indebtedness from any Bank to the
Company (including all account balances, whether provisional or final and
whether or not collected or available but excluding any accounts designated as
or representing "customer segregated funds" accounts and any accounts pledged to
such Bank to secure an overdraft facility to ensure the settlement of foreign
currency futures and options contracts traded on the Company) may be offset and
applied


                                       44
<Page>

toward the payment of the Obligations owing to such Bank, whether or not the
Obligations, or any part thereof, shall then be due.

          (b) If any Bank, whether by setoff or otherwise, has payment made to
it upon any Loan in a greater proportion than that received by any other Bank
upon any Loan constituting a portion of the same Advance, such Bank (or, if
applicable, such Bank's Servicing Bank) shall distribute to all the other Banks
(of, if applicable, such other Banks' Servicing Banks) an amount equal to their
pro rata share of such payment. Such payment shall be distributed ratably
between the Banks in proportion to each Bank's respective share of the total
Obligations outstanding under this Agreement. Any payment distributed pursuant
to this subsection (b) to a Servicing Bank shall be distributed by the Servicing
Banks to the applicable Banks in accordance with the provisions of this
Agreement.

          (c) If any Bank, whether in connection with setoff or amounts which
might be subject to setoff or otherwise, receives collateral or other protection
for any category of its Obligations or such amounts which may be subject to
setoff, in any case, in excess of its pro rata share thereof, such Bank agrees,
promptly upon demand, to take such action necessary such that all Banks share in
the benefits of such collateral ratably in proportion to their Obligations of
the same category. In case any such payment is disturbed by legal process, or
otherwise, appropriate further adjustments shall be made.

          (d) The Company agrees that any holder of a participation in a Loan
may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all its rights of payment
with respect to such participation as if such holder were the direct creditor of
the Company in the amount of the participation.

                                  ARTICLE XIII

                                     NOTICES

          13.1 GIVING NOTICE. Except as otherwise herein provided, any notice
required or permitted to be given under this Agreement shall be in writing and

service, or (ii) when sent by facsimile, telex or SWIFT message, in each case,
addressed to the Company and the Banks at the addresses or transmission numbers
indicated below their signatures to the Agreement or otherwise notified to the

address for service of notice upon it by a notice in writing to the other
parties hereto.

                                  ARTICLE XIV

                                  COUNTERPARTS

          This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, all of
which taken together shall constitute one agreement, and any of the parties
hereto may execute this Agreement by signing any such counterpart. This
Agreement shall be effective when it has been executed by the Company and the
Banks.

                                   ARTICLE XV

                                  SUBORDINATION


          The Company hereby subordinates its Lien on the Collateral to the Lien
therein granted to the Collateral Agent pursuant to the Collateral Documents,
and, except as permitted by SECTION 2.9, the Company shall not take any action
of any nature whatsoever to enforce its Lien until all of the Obligations have
been paid in full and the Commitments have been terminated.
