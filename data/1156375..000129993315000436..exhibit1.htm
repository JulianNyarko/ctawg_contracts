the obligation of the USD Swing Line Lenders to make USD Swing Line Loans) have terminated or
expired, such Applicable Percentage shall be determined based upon the percentage of the Aggregate
USD Credit Exposures represented by such Lender&#146;s USD Credit Exposure. The initial Applicable
Percentage of each Lender is set forth opposite the name of such Lender on <U>Schedule&nbsp;2.01</U>

Swing Line Lender on <U>Schedule&nbsp;1.01</U>, or in the Assignment and Assumption pursuant to which

make USD Swing Line Loans has terminated or expired, such Applicable USD Swing Line Percentage
shall be determined based upon the percentage of the outstanding amount of all USD Swing Line Loans
represented by such USD Swing Line Lender&#146;s outstanding USD Swing Line Loans. As of the Closing

Non-USD Swing Line Lender make a USD Committed Loan bearing interest at the Base
Rate in an amount equal to such USD Lender&#146;s Applicable Percentage of the amount of
such USD Swing Line Loan then outstanding. Such request shall be made in writing
(which request shall have the same force and effect as if made by the Borrower) and
in accordance with the requirements of <U>Section&nbsp;2.04</U>, without regard to the
minimum and multiples specified therein for the principal amount of Base Rate Loans,
but subject to the unutilized portion of the Aggregate USD Commitments and there
existing no Default or Event of Default at the time such USD Swing Line Loan is
deemed an USD Committed Loan. The applicable USD Swing Line Lender shall furnish
the Borrower with a copy of the applicable request promptly after delivering such
request to the Administrative Agent. Each such Non-USD Swing Line Lender shall make
an amount equal to its Applicable Percentage (with respect to the USD Credit
Facility) of the amount specified in such request available to the Administrative
Agent in Same Day Funds (and the Administrative Agent may apply Cash Collateral
available with respect to the applicable USD Swing Line Loan) for the account of the

whereupon, subject to <U>Section&nbsp;2.08(c)(ii)</U>, each USD Lender that so makes
funds available shall be deemed to have made an USD Committed Loan bearing interest
at the Base Rate to the Borrower in such amount. The Administrative Agent shall
remit the funds so received to the applicable USD Swing Line Lender.

USD Committed Borrowing in accordance with <U>Section&nbsp;2.08(c)(i)</U>, the request
for Base Rate USD Committed Loans submitted by the USD Swing Line Lender as set
forth herein shall be deemed to be a request by the USD Swing Line Lender that each

Swing Line Loan and each Non-USD Swing Line Lender&#146;s payment to the Administrative
Agent for the account of the applicable USD Swing Line Lender pursuant to
<U>Section&nbsp;2.08(c)(i)</U> shall be deemed payment in respect of such risk

applicable USD Swing Line Lender at a rate per annum equal to the applicable
Overnight Rate from time to time in effect, plus any administrative, processing or
similar fees customarily charged by such USD Swing Line Lender in connection with

funded participation in the relevant USD Swing Line Loan, as the case may be. A
certificate of the applicable USD Swing Line Lender submitted to any Non-USD Swing

the Applicable Issuing Party. Any notice given by the Applicable Issuing Party or
the Administrative Agent pursuant to this <U>Section&nbsp;2.09(c)(i)</U> may be given by
telephone if immediately confirmed in writing; provided that the lack of such an
immediate confirmation shall not affect the conclusiveness or binding effect of such
notice.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:8%; font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">(ii)&nbsp;With respect to any Drawing Request, if same day funds are not received by
the Administrative Agent from the Borrower prior to the Reimbursement Time on the
Reimbursement Date in the amount of such Drawing Request, the Administrative Agent
shall promptly notify each MC Lender of such Drawing Request, the amount of the
unreimbursed drawing (the &#147;<U>Unreimbursed Amount</U>&#148;) and such MC Lender&#146;s
Applicable Percentage of such Unreimbursed Amount. In such event, the Borrower
shall be deemed to have requested a Base Rate Committed Borrowing to be disbursed on
the Reimbursement Date in an amount equal to the Unreimbursed Amount, without regard
to the minimum and multiples specified in <U>Section&nbsp;2.03</U> for the principal
amount of Base Rate Committed Borrowings, but subject to the unutilized portion of
the Aggregate Commitments (after giving effect to payment of such Unreimbursed
Amount) and the conditions set forth in <U>Section&nbsp;4.02</U> (other than delivery of
any Committed Borrowing Request). Each MC Lender shall make funds available to the
Administrative Agent for the account of the Applicable Issuing Party at the
Administrative Agent&#146;s Office in an amount equal to its Applicable Percentage of the
Unreimbursed Amount not later than 1:00 p.m. on such Reimbursement Date. The
Administrative Agent shall remit the funds so received to the Applicable Issuing
Party. To the extent that same day funds are received by the Administrative Agent
from the MC Lenders with respect to a Several Letter of Credit prior to 2:00 p.m. on
the Reimbursement Date, the Administrative Agent shall notify the Several L/C Agent
and the Several L/C Agent shall promptly make such funds available to the
beneficiary of such Several Letter of Credit on such date. To the extent that the
Several L/C Agent has not delivered funds to any beneficiary of a Several Letter of
Credit on behalf of a an MC Lender on the Reimbursement Date, if same day funds are
received by the Administrative Agent from such MC Lender: (i)&nbsp;after 2:00 p.m. on the
Reimbursement Date the Several L/C Agent shall make such funds available to such
beneficiary on the next Business Day; (ii)&nbsp;prior to 2:00 p.m. on any Business Day
after the Reimbursement Date, the Several L/C Agent shall make those funds available
to such beneficiary on such Business Day; and (iii)&nbsp;after 2:00 p.m. on any Business
Day after the Reimbursement Date, the Several L/C Agent shall make those funds
available to such beneficiary on the next Business Day following such Business Day.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:8%; font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">(iii)&nbsp;Unless the Administrative Agent or Several L/C Agent receives notice from
an MC Lender prior to any Reimbursement Date with respect to a Several Letter of
Credit that such MC Lender will not make available as and when required hereunder to
the Administrative Agent the amount of such MC Lender&#146;s L/C Advance on such
Reimbursement Date, the Administrative Agent and the Several L/C Agent may assume
that such MC Lender has made such amount available to the Administrative Agent in
same day funds on the Reimbursement Date and the Several L/C Agent may (but shall
not be required), in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the
beneficiary of the related Several Letter of Credit on such date such MC Lender&#146;s
L/C Advance.

Borrowing of Base Rate Loans because the conditions set forth in <U>Section
4.02</U> cannot be satisfied or for any other reason, the Borrower shall be deemed
to have incurred an L/C Advance in the amount of the Unreimbursed Amount that is not
so refinanced from (x)&nbsp;in the case of Fronted Letters of Credit, the Fronting Bank
and (y)&nbsp;in the case of Several Letters of Credit, from the MC Lenders to the extent
that they have provided funds with respect to such Several Letter of Credit pursuant
to <U>Section&nbsp;2.09(c)(ii)</U>; <U>provided</U> that the making of such L/C Advance
shall not constitute a Default or Event of Default hereunder. L/C Advances shall be
due and payable on demand by the Administrative Agent at the request of the Required
MC Lenders (together with interest) and shall bear interest at the rate then
applicable to Base Rate Loans <U>plus</U>, at any time during the continuance of an
Event of Default under Article&nbsp;VII (a), (b), (h)&nbsp;or (i), 2%. Each MC Lender&#146;s
payment to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Applicable Issuing Party
pursuant to <U>Section&nbsp;2.09(c)(ii)</U> shall be deemed payment in respect of its
participation in such L/C Advance and shall constitute an L/C Advance from such MC
Lender in satisfaction of its participation obligation under this <U>Section
2.09</U>. Any payment by the Borrower in respect of such L/C Advance shall be made
to the Administrative Agent and upon receipt applied by the Administrative Agent in
accordance with <U>Section&nbsp;2.09(d)</U>.

<U>Section&nbsp;2.09(c)</U> to reimburse the Applicable Issuing Party for any amount
drawn under any Letter of Credit, interest in respect of such MC Lender&#146;s Applicable
Percentage of such Unreimbursed Amount shall be solely for the account of the
Fronting Bank or the Several L/C Agent, as applicable.

by this <U>Section&nbsp;2.09(c)</U>, shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not
be affected by any circumstance, including (A)&nbsp;any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment,
defense or other right which such MC Lender may have against the Administrative
Agent, the Applicable Issuing Party, any Lender, the Borrower any Subsidiary, any
beneficiary named in any Letter of Credit, any transferee of any Letter of Credit
(or any Persons for whom any such transferee may be acting) or any other Person for
any reason whatsoever, (B)&nbsp;the occurrence or continuance of a Default, (C)&nbsp;any lack
of validity or enforceability of such Letter of Credit, this Agreement or any other
Loan Document, (D)&nbsp;any draft, certificate or any other document presented under any

the terms of the Loan Documents, (F)&nbsp;any matter or event set forth in <U>Section
2.09(b)(i)</U>, or (G)&nbsp;any other occurrence, event or condition, whether or not
similar to any of the foregoing. No such making of an L/C Advance shall relieve or
otherwise impair the obligation of the Borrower to reimburse the respective L/C
Issuers for the amount of any payment made by the respective L/C Issuers under any
Letter of Credit, together with interest as provided herein.

MC Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this <U>Section&nbsp;2.09(c)</U> by
the time specified in the third sentence of <U>Section&nbsp;2.09(c)(ii)</U> then,
without limiting the other provisions of this Agreement, the Applicable Issuing
Party, shall be entitled to recover from such MC Lender (acting through the
Administrative Agent), on demand, such amount with interest thereon for the period
from the date such payment is required to the date on which such payment is
immediately available to the Applicable Issuing Party, as the case may be, at a rate
per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate, plus any administrative, processing or
similar fees customarily charged by the Applicable Issuing Party in connection with
the foregoing. A certificate of the Applicable Issuing Party, submitted to any MC

willful failure to pay under any Letter of Credit after the presentation to it by the beneficiary

Conversions, there may be non-pro rata payments of Loans as well as reallocations of participations
in outstanding Swing Line Loans and Letters of Credit. In the event there are any Loans or L/C
Advances outstanding as of the date of any Tranche Conversion, (i)&nbsp;each applicable MC Lender or USD
Lender, as the case may be, shall make available to the Administrative Agent such amounts in
immediately available funds as the Administrative Agent shall determine, for the benefit of the
other relevant MC Lenders or USD Lenders, as the case may be, as being required in order to cause,

risk participations in outstanding Swing Line Loans) to be held ratably by all Lenders in
accordance with their respective Applicable Percentages in the MC Credit Facility and/or the USD
Credit Facility, as the case may be, after giving effect to any such Tranche Conversion, and (ii)

L/C Advances ratable with any revised Applicable Percentages in the MC Credit Facility and/or the
USD Credit Facility, as the case may be, arising from any such date of any Tranche Conversion.
Participations in Swing Line Loans and Letters of Credit (or the respective amounts of a Several
Letter of Credit) shall also be reallocated to the extent necessary so that such participations are
ratable with any revised Applicable Percentages in the MC Credit Facility and/or the USD Credit
Facility, as the case may be, after giving effect to any such Tranche Conversion.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(g)&nbsp;Each MC Lender may enter into fronting arrangements with another MC Lender or any other
Person acceptable to the Administrative Agent, the Fronting Bank and the Borrower to front such MC
Lender&#146;s obligations with respect to any Several Letters of Credit issued or outstanding (pursuant
to documentation satisfactory to such MC Lender, the Administrative Agent and the Borrower);
<U>provided</U> that (1)&nbsp;such MC Lender&#146;s obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged,

of such obligations and (3)&nbsp;the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall continue
to deal solely and directly with such MC Lender in connection with such MC Lender&#146;s rights and

equal to 105% of the Aggregate MC Commitments then in effect, then, within two Business Days after
receipt of such notice, the Borrower shall prepay MC Loans and/or MC Swing Line Loans, as the

Section&nbsp;1.01 of this Agreement, for such Interest Period with respect to a proposed
Eurocurrency Rate Loan (whether denominated in Dollars or an Alternative Currency)

unlawful, for such Lender or its applicable Lending Office to make, maintain or fund Loans whose
interest is determined by reference to such alternative rate of interest or to determine or charge
interest rates based upon such rate or any Governmental Authority has imposed material restrictions
on the authority of such Lender to do any of the foregoing and provides the Administrative Agent
and the Borrower written notice thereof.

Alternative Currency), or to determine or charge interest rates based upon the Eurocurrency Rate,

the Administrative Agent without reference to the Eurocurrency Rate component of the Base Rate, in

<U>provided</U> that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender, the Several L/C

reductions incurred more than 180&nbsp;days prior to the date that such Lender, the Several L/C Agent or

such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender&#146;s, the Several L/C Agent&#146;s or the Fronting
Bank&#146;s intention to claim compensation therefor; <U>provided</U> <U>further</U> that, if the

Borrower pursuant to <U>Section&nbsp;2.18</U>, then, in any such event, the Borrower shall compensate
each Lender for the loss, cost and expense (other than lost profits) attributable to such event.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, such loss, cost or expense to any Lender shall not exceed the
excess, if any, of (i)&nbsp;the amount of interest which would have accrued on the principal amount of
such Loan had such event not occurred, at the Eurocurrency Rate that would have been applicable to
such Loan, for the period from the date of such event to the last day of the then current Interest
Period therefor (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, convert or continue, for the period that
would have been the Interest Period for such Loan), over (ii)&nbsp;the greater of (x)&nbsp;if readily
determinable by such Lender with reasonable effort, the amount of interest actually earned by such
Lender from investing such principal amount in comparable investments for such period and (y)&nbsp;the

<U>Section&nbsp;2.17</U> shall be delivered to the Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest
error, <U>provided</U> that the method of calculation is consistent with bank industry practices

required by applicable law; <U>provided</U> that, if the Borrower shall be required to deduct any
Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes from such payments, then (i)&nbsp;the sum payable shall be increased as
necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to
additional sums payable under this <U>Section&nbsp;2.18</U>), the Administrative Agent or Lender (as
the case may be) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions
been made, (ii)&nbsp;the Borrower shall make such deductions and (iii)&nbsp;the Borrower shall pay the full
amount deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law. For
purposes of this <U>Section&nbsp;2.18</U>, the term &#147;applicable law&#148; includes FATCA.

reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified
Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental
Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Borrower
by a Lender, the Several L/C Agent or the Fronting Bank (with a copy to the Administrative Agent),
or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender, the Fronting Bank or the
Several L/C Agent, setting forth the basis and calculation of such amounts, shall be conclusive
absent manifest error.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(d)&nbsp;As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes by the
Borrower to a Governmental Authority, the Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the
original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such
payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably
satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.

prescribed by applicable law, such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by
applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will permit
such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding.

federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable
reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or Section 1472(b) of
the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent at
the time or times prescribed by law and at such other time or times as reasonably requested by the
Borrower or the Administrative Agent (A)&nbsp;a certification signed by an appropriate officer of such
Lender, and (B)&nbsp;such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including Section&nbsp;1471(b)(3)(C)(i)
of the Code) or as may be reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to
comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that the Lender has complied with the
Lender&#146;s obligations under FATCA or to determine the deduction or withholding required to be made
from each payment. Each Lender agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered
expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall update such form or
certification or promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent in writing of its legal
inability to do so.

making any required payment hereunder in an Alternative Currency, such Borrower shall make such
payment in Dollars in the Dollar Equivalent of the Alternative Currency payment amount. The
Administrative Agent shall distribute any such payments received by it for the account of any other

other Lenders, or make such other adjustments as shall be equitable, to the extent necessary so

Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof (as to which the provisions of this paragraph shall apply) or (z)
any payment obtained by or made by a Lender in order to give effect to a Tranche Conversion in
accordance with <U>Section&nbsp;2.10(e)</U>. The Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the
extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation
pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against the Borrower rights of set-off and
counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor
of the Borrower in the amount of such participation.

Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to <U>Section

<U>Section&nbsp;2.15(a) </U>or <U>(b)</U>, then, at the request of the Borrower, such Lender shall use
reasonable efforts to designate a different Lending Office for funding or booking its Loans
hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or
affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i)&nbsp;would eliminate

prohibition on making Eurocurrency Rate Loans pursuant to <U>Section&nbsp;2.15(b)</U>, as the case may
be, and (ii)&nbsp;would not subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense and would
not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender in any material respect. The Borrower hereby

another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment); <U>provided</U> that (i)&nbsp;if such assignee is
not another Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender, the Borrower shall have received the prior written
consent of the Administrative Agent and, in the case of an assignment under the MC Credit Facility,
the MC Swing Line Lenders, the Fronting Bank and the Several L/C Agent, and, in the case of an
assignment under the USD Credit Facility, the USD Swing Line Lenders, which consents shall not
unreasonably be withheld. conditioned or delayed, (ii)&nbsp;such Lender shall have received payment of
an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans and L/C Advances, accrued interest
thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder, from the assignee (to the
extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrower (in the case of
all other amounts) and any outstanding Several Letters of Credit have been amended or returned and

claim for compensation under <U>Section&nbsp;2.16</U> or payments required to be made pursuant to
<U>Section&nbsp;2.18</U>, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments
and, in the case of any such assignment resulting from an amendment, waiver or consent not approved
by the assigning Lender, the assignee has agreed to approve such amendment, waiver or consent. A
Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment and delegation if, prior thereto, as a
result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrower to require
such assignment and delegation cease to apply. Each Lender agrees to comply with this <U>Section
2.20(b)</U> and grants to the Administrative Agent a power of attorney to execute an Assignment and
Assumption if such Lender does not so execute an Assignment and Assumption within five (5)&nbsp;days of
its receipt of a request from the Borrower under this <U>Section&nbsp;2.20(b)</U>.

the Board to maintain reserves with respect to liabilities or assets consisting of or including
&#147;Eurocurrency liabilities&#148; (as defined in Regulation&nbsp;D thereof), additional interest on the unpaid
principal amount of each Eurocurrency Rate Loan of such Lender equal to the actual costs of such
reserves allocated to such Loan by such Lender (as determined by such Lender in good faith, which
determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error), which shall be due and payable on each
date on which interest is payable on such Loan, <U>provided</U> that the Borrower shall have
received at least 10&nbsp;days&#146; prior written notice (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) of such
additional interest from such Lender. If a Lender fails to give written notice 10&nbsp;days prior to
the relevant Interest Payment Date, such additional interest shall be due and payable 10&nbsp;days from
receipt of such written notice.

L/C Agent and the Fronting Bank, and, in the case of an increase in Aggregate USD Commitments, the
USD Swing Line Lenders, all of which approvals shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or

such request for an increase shall be in a minimum amount of $10,000,000, or a whole multiple of
$5,000,000 in excess thereof. At the time of sending such notice, the Borrower (in consultation
with the Administrative Agent) shall specify the time period within which each applicable Lender
and Eligible Assignee is requested to respond (which shall in no event be less than ten Business
Days from the date of delivery of such notice to such Persons unless the Administrative Agent and
the Borrower otherwise agree).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(b)&nbsp;<U>Lender Elections to Increase</U>. Each applicable Lender shall notify the
Administrative Agent within such time period whether or not it agrees to increase its USD
Commitment or MC Commitment and, if so, by what amount; <U>provided</U> that the Borrower may
determine, in its sole discretion, to accept all, a portion of or none of such increase agreed to
by such Lender. Any applicable Lender not responding within such time period shall be deemed to
have declined to increase its USD Commitment or the MC Commitments, as the case may be.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(c)&nbsp;<U>Notification by Administrative Agent; Additional Lenders</U>. The Administrative

F</U> attached hereto. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Administrative
Agent and the Borrower may, without the consent of any other Lender, amend this Agreement to the
extent (but only to the extent) necessary, in the opinion of the Administrative Agent and the
Borrower only, to solely effect the provisions of this <U>Section&nbsp;2.22</U>.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(d)&nbsp;<U>Effective Date and Allocations</U>. If the Aggregate USD Commitments or the Aggregate
MC Commitments are increased in accordance with this Section, the Administrative Agent and the
Borrower shall determine the effective date (the &#147;<U>Increase Effective Date</U>&#148;) and the final
allocation of such increase. The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower and the
Lenders of the final allocation of such increase and such Increase Effective Date. This Agreement
shall be deemed to be automatically amended to increase the USD Commitments or the MC Commitments,
as applicable, on the Increase Effective Date, without the need for any other consents.

material respects on and as of the Increase Effective Date, except to the extent that such
representations and warranties specifically refer to an earlier date, in which case they shall have
been true and correct in all material respects as of such earlier date, and except that for
purposes of this <U>Section&nbsp;2.22</U>, the representations and warranties contained in <U>Section

<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">8.01 <U>Appointment and Authority</U>. Each of the Lenders, each L/C Issuer, the Several L/C
Agent and the Fronting Bank hereby irrevocably appoints Bank of America to act on its behalf as the
Administrative Agent hereunder and under the other Loan Documents and authorizes the Administrative
Agent to take such actions on its behalf and to exercise such powers as are delegated to the
Administrative Agent by the terms hereof and thereof, together with such actions and powers as are
reasonably incidental thereto. The provisions of this Article are solely for the benefit of the
Administrative Agent, the Lenders, the L/C Issuers, the Several L/C Agent and the Fronting Bank,
and the Borrower shall not have rights as a third party beneficiary of any of such provisions. It
is understood and agreed that the use of the term &#147;agent&#148; herein or in any other Loan Documents (or
any other similar term) with reference to the Administrative Agent is not intended to connote any
fiduciary or other implied (or express) obligations arising under agency doctrine of any applicable
Law. Instead such term is used as a matter of market custom, and is intended to create or reflect
only an administrative relationship between contracting parties.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">8.02 <U>Rights as a Lender</U>. The Person serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder
shall have the same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may

advisor or in any other advisory capacity for and generally engage in any kind of business with the
Borrower or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof as if such Person were not the Administrative

obligations except those expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents, and its duties
shall be administrative in nature. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
Administrative Agent:


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(a)&nbsp;shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a
Default has occurred and is continuing;


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(b)&nbsp;shall not have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary
powers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated hereby or by the other Loan
Documents that the Administrative Agent is required to exercise as directed in writing by the
Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be expressly provided
for herein or in the other Loan Documents), <U>provided</U> that the Administrative Agent shall
not be required to take any action that, in its opinion or the opinion of its counsel, may expose
the Administrative Agent to liability or that is contrary to this Agreement or any other Loan
Document or applicable law, including for the avoidance of doubt any action that may be in
violation of the automatic stay under any Federal, state or foreign bankruptcy, insolvency,
receivership, or similar law or that may effect a forfeiture, modification or termination of
property of a Defaulting Lender in violation of any Federal, state or foreign bankruptcy,
insolvency, receivership, or similar law; and


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(c)&nbsp;shall not, except as expressly set forth herein and the other Loan Documents, have any
duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to

the Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">The Administrative Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it (i)&nbsp;with

Lenders as shall be necessary, or as the Administrative Agent shall believe in good faith shall be
necessary, under the circumstances as provided in <U>Sections&nbsp;9.02</U> and <U>Article&nbsp;VII</U> )
or (ii)&nbsp;in the absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct as determined by a court
of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment. The Administrative Agent shall be
deemed not to have knowledge of any Default unless and until notice describing such Default is
given in writing to the Administrative Agent by the Borrower, a Lender, the Several L/C Agent, or
the Fronting Bank.

the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth herein or therein or the
occurrence of any Default, (iv)&nbsp;the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of this
Agreement, any other Loan Document or any other agreement, instrument or document or (v)&nbsp;the
satisfaction of any condition set forth in <U>Article&nbsp;IV</U> or elsewhere herein, other than to
confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to the Administrative Agent.

rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate,
consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing (including any electronic message,
Internet or intranet website posting or other distribution) believed by it to be genuine and to
have been signed, sent or otherwise authenticated by the proper Person. The Administrative Agent
also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to have been
made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon. In determining
compliance with any condition hereunder to the making of a Loan, or the issuance, extension,
renewal or increase of a Letter of Credit, that by its terms must be fulfilled to the satisfaction
of a Lender or the Applicable Issuing Party, the Administrative Agent may presume that such
condition is satisfactory to such Lender or the Applicable Issuing Party unless the Administrative
Agent shall have received notice to the contrary from such Lender or the Applicable Issuing Party
prior to the making of such Loan or the issuance of such Letter of Credit. The Administrative
Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the Borrower), independent accountants
and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it
in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">8.05 <U>Delegation of Duties.</U> The Administrative Agent may perform any and all of its
duties and exercise its rights and powers hereunder or under any other Loan Document by or through
any one or more sub-agents appointed by the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent and any
such sub-agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or
through their respective Related Parties. The exculpatory provisions of this Article shall apply
to any such sub-agent and to the Related Parties of the Administrative Agent and any such
sub-agent, and shall apply to their respective activities in connection with the syndication of the
credit facilities provided for herein as well as activities as Administrative Agent. The
Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any sub-agents
except to the extent that the Administrative Agent acted with bad faith, gross negligence or
willful misconduct in the selection of such sub-agents.

with effect from the Resignation Effective Date (1)&nbsp;the retiring Administrative Agent shall be

any rights to indemnity payments or other amounts owed to the retiring or removed Administrative
Agent as of the Resignation Effective Date), and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be
discharged from all of its duties and obligations hereunder (if not already discharged therefrom as
provided above in this Section). The fees payable by the Borrower to a successor Administrative
Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the
Borrower and such successor. After the retiring Administrative Agent&#146;s resignation hereunder, the
provisions of this Article and <U>Section&nbsp;9.03</U> shall continue in effect for the benefit of
such retiring Administrative Agent, its sub-agents and their respective Related Parties in respect
of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while the retiring Administrative Agent

of this Section, from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and Assumption, the

with respect to facts and circumstances occurring prior to the effective date of such assignment;
<U>provided</U>, that except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no

hereunder arising from that Lender&#146;s having been a Defaulting Lender. Upon request, the Borrower
(at its expense) shall execute and deliver a promissory note in the applicable form attached hereto
to the assignee Lender. Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this
Agreement that does not comply with this subsection shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement

subsection (d)&nbsp;of this Section.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(c)&nbsp;<U>Register</U>. The Administrative Agent, acting solely for this purpose as an agent of

and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the USD
Commitment of, the MC Commitment of, and principal amounts (and stated interest) of the Loans owing
to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the &#147;<U>Register</U>&#148;). The
entries in the Register shall be conclusive, absent manifest error, and the Borrower, the
Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register
pursuant to the terms hereof as the owner of its interest hereunder for all purposes of this
Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. The Register shall be available for inspection
by the Borrower, the Several L/C Agent, the Fronting Bank and any Lender, at any reasonable time
and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice. Upon its receipt of a duly completed

the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Several L/C Agent, the Fronting Bank and the Lenders
shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender&#146;s rights
and obligations under this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, each Lender shall be responsible
for the indemnity under <U>Section&nbsp;9.03(c)</U> without regard to the existence of any
participation.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt">Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide
that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any
amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement; <U>provided</U> that such
agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the
Participant, agree to any amendment, waiver or other modification described in the first proviso to
<U>Section&nbsp;9.02(b)(i) through (vii)</U> that affects such Participant. Subject to subsection (e)
of this Section, the Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of
<U>Sections&nbsp;2.16</U>, <U>2.17</U> and <U>2.18</U> to the same extent as if it were a Lender and
had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to subsection (b)&nbsp;of this Section. Subject to
subsection (e)&nbsp;of this Section, to the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be
entitled to the benefits of <U>Section&nbsp;9.08</U> as though it were a Lender, <U>provided</U> such
Participant agrees to be subject to <U>Section&nbsp;2.19</U> as though it were a Lender.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt">Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely as a non-fiduciary agent (solely for
tax purposes) of the Borrower, maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each
Participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each Participant&#146;s interest in the
Loans or other obligations under this Agreement (the &#147;<U>Participant Register</U>&#148;);
<U>provided</U> that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the
Participant Register to any Person (including the identity of any Participant or any information
relating to a Participant&#146;s interest in any commitments, loans, letters of credit or its other
obligations under this Agreement) except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to
establish that such commitment, loan or other obligation is in registered form under Section
5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations. The entries in the Participant Register
shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and a Lender shall treat each person whose name is
recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this
Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary. For the avoidance of doubt, the
Administrative Agent (in its capacity as Administrative Agent) shall have no responsibility for
maintaining a Participant Register.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(e)&nbsp;<U>Limitations upon Participant Rights</U>. A Participant shall not be entitled to
receive any greater payment under <U>Section&nbsp;2.16</U> or <U>2.18</U> than the applicable Lender
would have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant,
unless the sale of the participation to such Participant is made with the Borrower&#146;s prior written
consent. A Participant that would be a Foreign Lender if it were a Lender shall not be entitled to
the benefits of <U>Section&nbsp;2.18</U> unless the Borrower is notified of the participation sold to
such Participant and such Participant agrees, for the benefit of the Borrower, to comply with
<U>Section&nbsp;2.18</U> as though it were a Lender. Each Participant shall be entitled to the
benefits of <U>Sections&nbsp;2.16</U>, <U>2.17</U>, <U>2.18</U> and <U>9.08</U> to the same extent
as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to <U>Section
9.04(b)</U>, but only after the Participant&#146;s participation is entered, at the Participant&#146;s
request, in the Register as if the Participant were an assignee, it being understood that the
participation shall not be entered in the Register until such time as the Participant wishes to be
entitled to the benefits of <U>Sections&nbsp;2.16</U>, <U>2.17</U>, <U>2.18</U> or <U>9.08</U>.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(f)&nbsp;<U>Certain Pledges</U>. Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest
in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement (including under any promissory note
executed in connection herewith) to secure obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or
assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank; <U>provided</U> that no such pledge or
assignment shall release such Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such
pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.

such information that is available to the Administrative Agent, the Fronting Bank, or any Lender
from a public source prior to disclosure by the Borrower.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">9.13 <U>USA PATRIOT Act</U>. Each Lender hereby notifies the Borrower that pursuant to the
requirements of the USA PATRIOT Act (Title III of Pub. L. 107-56 (signed into law October&nbsp;26,
2001)), such Lender may be required to obtain, verify and record information that identifies the
Borrower, which information includes the name and address of the Borrower and other information
that will allow such Lender to identify the Borrower in accordance with said Act and the Borrower
agrees to provide such information promptly upon the reasonable request of each Lender.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">9.14 <U>No Advisory or Fiduciary Responsibility</U>. In connection with this Agreement or
any promissory note delivered hereunder (including in connection with any amendment, waiver or
other modification hereof), the Borrower acknowledges and agrees, and acknowledges its
subsidiaries&#146; understanding, that: (i) (A)&nbsp;the arranging and other services regarding this
Agreement provided by the Administrative Agent, the Fronting Bank, the Several L/C Agent, the
Lenders, the L/C Issuers and the Arrangers are arm&#146;s-length commercial transactions between the
Borrower and its Affiliates, on the one hand, and the Administrative Agent, the Fronting Bank, the
Several L/C Agent, the Lenders, the L/C Issuers and the Arrangers, on the other hand, (B)&nbsp;the
Borrower has consulted its own legal, accounting, regulatory and tax advisors to the extent it has
deemed appropriate, and (C)&nbsp;the Borrower is capable of evaluating, and understands and accepts, the
terms, risks and conditions of the transactions contemplated hereby; (ii) (A)&nbsp;the Administrative
Agent, the Fronting Bank, the Several L/C Agent, the Lenders, the L/C Issuers and the Arrangers
each is and has been acting solely as a principal and, except as expressly agreed in writing by the
relevant parties, has not been, is not, and will not be acting as an advisor, agent or fiduciary
for the Borrower or any of its Affiliates, or any other Person and (B)&nbsp;neither the Administrative
Agent, the Fronting Bank, the Several L/C Agent, any L/C Issuer, any Lender nor any Arranger has
any obligation to the Borrower or any of its Affiliates with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby except those obligations expressly set forth herein; and (iii)&nbsp;the
Administrative Agent, the Fronting Bank, the Several L/C Agent, the L/C Issuers, the Lenders and
the Arrangers and their respective Affiliates may be engaged in a broad range of transactions that
involve interests that differ from those of the Borrower and its Affiliates, and neither the
Administrative Agent, the Fronting Bank, the Several L/C Agent, any L/C Issuer, any Lender nor any
Arranger has any obligation to disclose any of such interests to the Borrower or its Affiliates.
To the fullest extent permitted by law, the Borrower hereby waives and releases any claims that it
may have against the Administrative Agent, the Fronting Bank, the Several L/C Agent, any L/C
Issuer, any Lender or any Arranger with respect to any breach or alleged breach of agency or
fiduciary duty (except for any agency or fiduciary duty obligations expressly agreed in writing by
the relevant parties) in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">9.15 <U>Judgment Currency</U>. If, for the purposes of obtaining judgment in any court, it
is necessary to convert a sum due hereunder in one currency into another currency, the rate of
exchange used shall be that at which in accordance with normal banking procedures the
Administrative Agent could purchase the first currency with such other currency on the Business Day
preceding that on which final judgment is given. The obligation of the Borrower in respect of any
such sum due from it to the Administrative Agent or any Lender hereunder shall, notwithstanding any
judgment in a currency (the &#147;<U>Judgment Currency</U>&#148;) other than that in which such sum is
denominated in accordance with the applicable provisions of this Agreement (the &#147;<U>Agreement
Currency</U>&#148;), be discharged only to the extent that on the Business Day following receipt by the
Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, of any sum adjudged to be so due in the
Judgment Currency, the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, may in accordance
with normal banking procedures purchase the Agreement Currency with the Judgment Currency. If the
amount of the Agreement Currency so purchased is less than the sum originally due to the
Administrative Agent or any Lender from the Borrower in the Agreement Currency, the Borrower
agrees, as a separate obligation and notwithstanding any such judgment, to indemnify the
Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, against such loss. If the amount of the
Agreement Currency so purchased is greater than the sum originally due to the Administrative Agent
or any Lender in such currency, the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, agrees
to return the amount of any excess to the Borrower (or to any other Person who may be entitled
thereto under applicable law).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">9.16 <U>Electronic Execution of Assignments and Certain Other Documents</U>. The words
&#147;delivery,&#148; &#147;execute,&#148; &#147;execution,&#148; &#147;signed,&#148; &#147;signature,&#148; and words of like import in any Loan
Document or any other document executed in connection herewith shall be deemed to include
electronic signatures, the electronic matching of assignment terms and contract formations on
electronic platforms approved by the Administrative Agent, or the keeping of records in electronic
form, each of which shall be of the same legal effect, validity or enforceability as a manually
executed signature, physical delivery thereof or the use of a paper-based recordkeeping system, as
the case may be, to the extent and as provided for in any applicable Law, including the Federal
Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act, the New York State Electronic Signatures
and Records Act, or any other similar state laws based on the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act;
provided that notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary neither the Administrative
Agent, the Several L/C Agent, the Fronting Bank, any L/C Issuer nor any Lender is under any
obligation to agree to accept electronic signatures in any form or in any format unless expressly
agreed to by the Administrative Agent, the Several L/C Agent, the Fronting Bank, such L/C Issuer or
such Lender pursuant to procedures approved by it and provided further without limiting the
foregoing, upon the request of any party, any electronic signature shall be promptly followed by
such manually executed counterpart.
