<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) <U>Positions and Duties</U>. Effective as of September&nbsp;1, 2008 (the &#147;<U>Commencement
Date</U>&#148;), the Company shall employ Executive as President of the Company. Executive shall report
directly to the Chief Executive Officer of the Company. Executive shall perform all the duties and
obligations reasonably associated with the position of President and consistent with the Bylaws of

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) <U>Obligations</U>. Executive shall devote substantially all his business time and
efforts to the rendition of services to the Company, and he shall use good faith efforts to
discharge Executive&#146;s obligations under this Agreement to the best of Executive&#146;s ability. During
the Term, Executive agrees not to actively engage in any other employment, occupation, or
consulting activity for any direct or indirect remuneration without the prior approval of the
Board; <I>provided</I>, <I>however</I>, that (i)&nbsp;Executive may, without the approval of the Board of Directors of
the Company (the &#147;<U>Board</U>&#148;) or the Chief Executive Officer, serve in any capacity with any
civic, educational, or community organization and (ii)&nbsp;Executive may, with the prior approval of
the Chief Executive Officer or of the Board (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld),
serve as a director of any company that is not directly or indirectly in competition with the
Company, in each case as long as such activities or service do not materially interfere with his
duties and obligations to the Company.

shall commence on the Commencement Date and, unless earlier terminated pursuant to Section&nbsp;7, shall
end on August&nbsp;31, 2012 (the &#147;<U>Initial Term</U>&#148;); <I>provided</I>, <I>however</I>, that the term of
Executive&#146;s employment under this Agreement shall be extended automatically for one additional year
as of the fourth anniversary and each subsequent anniversary of the Commencement Date (each such
additional year, an &#147;<U>Extended Term</U>&#148;; together with the Initial Term, the &#147;<U>Term</U>&#148;),
unless no later than one year prior to the last day of the then-current Term either the Board, on
behalf of the Company, or Executive gives written notice to the other that the Term shall not be so
extended. For example, notice of nonrenewal would need to be provided prior to September&nbsp;1, 2011
for the Term not to renew automatically on September&nbsp;1, 2012 for an additional one year.

annual salary of $425,000 as compensation for his services (such annual salary, as is then
effective, &#147;<U>Base Salary</U>&#148;), payable in installments in accordance with the Company&#146;s payroll
schedule from time to time (less any deductions required for Social Security, state, federal and
local withholding taxes, and any other authorized or mandated similar withholdings). The Base
Salary shall be reviewed by the Board and/or the Compensation Committee of the Board (the
&#147;<U>Committee</U>&#148;) no less frequently than annually and may be increased from its then-existing
level at the discretion of the Board or the Committee.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) <U>Annual Incentive Bonus</U>. Executive shall be eligible to earn bonuses with respect
to each fiscal year (or partial fiscal year) during the Term based upon Executive&#146;s achievement of
performance objectives set by the Committee after consultation with Executive. Executive&#146;s initial
annual incentive bonus target is $200,000. The actual incentive bonus payable to Executive for any
fiscal year (or partial fiscal year) shall be based upon criteria established and approved by the
Board and/or the Committee in its sole discretion, which need not be objective performance
criteria, and may be less than (including zero) or greater than the annual incentive bonus target
for such fiscal year (or partial fiscal year). Executive may also receive special bonuses in
additional to his annual bonus eligibility at the discretion of the Committee.

October&nbsp;2001 letter agreement regarding equity award agreements between Executive and the Company
(such letter agreement and any and all oral agreements relating thereto with respect to the subject
matter thereof, the &#147;<U>2001 Arrangements</U>&#148;), and (b)&nbsp;an Agreement Concerning Exclusive
Services, Confidential Information, Business Opportunities, Non-Competition, Non-Solicitation and
Work Product dated October&nbsp;18, 2001 (as such may be amended from time to time, the
&#147;<U>Non-Competition Agreement</U>&#148;). Effective as of the Commencement Date, this Agreement shall
supersede in its entirety the 2001 Arrangements. Executive and the Company hereby agree that,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Non-Competition Agreement, (i)&nbsp;if Executive&#146;s
employment is terminated by the Company without Cause or by Executive for Good Reason pursuant to
this Agreement, Executive shall comply with the provisions of Sections 4(a) and 5(a) of the
Non-Competition Agreement, in each case for the period commencing on the Termination Date and
continuing through the second anniversary thereof, as if Executive&#146;s employment was terminated by
the Company for Cause, (ii)&nbsp;a termination of Executive&#146;s employment by Executive for Good Reason

period of 90 consecutive days or for shorter periods aggregating to 120&nbsp;days (whether or not
consecutive) during any consecutive 12&nbsp;months of the Term. The Company, at its expense, may retain

incapacity.

which, upon such cure to the reasonable satisfaction of the Board, shall no longer constitute a
basis for Cause, and (B)&nbsp;Executive shall be given an opportunity to make a presentation to the
Board (accompanied by counsel or other representative, if Executive so desires) at a meeting of the
Board held promptly following such 45-day cure period if the Board intends to determine that no
cure has occurred. At or following such meeting, the Board shall determine whether or not to
terminate Executive with Cause and shall notify Executive of its determination and the effective
date of such termination (which date may be no earlier than the date of the aforementioned Board
meeting). For purposes hereof, no act or omission shall be deemed &#147;willful&#148; if it was done with a

(viii)&nbsp;a material diminution in Executive&#146;s authority, responsibilities or duties; <I>provided</I>,
<I>however</I>, that for any of the foregoing to constitute Good Reason, Executive must provide written
notification of such event or condition constituting Good Reason within 90&nbsp;days after Executive
knows of the occurrence of any such event or condition, and the Company shall have 60&nbsp;days from the
date of receipt of such written notice to effect a cure of the event or condition constituting Good
Reason, and, upon cure thereof by the Company, such event or condition shall no longer constitute
Good Reason.

notice to Executive. Executive may terminate Executive&#146;s employment without Good Reason upon 60

for a period of 18&nbsp;months after the date of Executive&#146;s separation from service, the Company shall
continue to provide medical, dental and vision care and life insurance benefits to Executive and/or
Executive&#146;s family at least equal to those which would have been provided to them in accordance
with Section&nbsp;4, provided that Executive agrees to elect COBRA coverage to the extent available
under the Company&#146;s health insurance plans (and the Company shall reimburse the cost of any
premiums for such coverage on an after-tax basis).

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) <U>Required Delay</U>. In the event that any compensation with respect to Executive&#146;s
termination is &#147;deferred compensation&#148; within the meaning of Section&nbsp;409A of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended (the &#147;<U>Code</U>&#148;) and the regulations promulgated thereunder

at the prime rate of interest as published by the Wall Street Journals&#146; bank survey as of the first

Executive of all taxes (and any interest or penalties imposed with respect to such taxes),
including any income and employment taxes and Excise Taxes imposed upon the Gross-Up Payment,
Executive retains an amount of the Gross-Up Payment equal to the Excise Tax imposed upon such
Payments. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section, if it shall be determined that
Executive is entitled to a Gross-Up Payment, but that the portion of the Payments that would be
treated as &#147;parachute payments&#148; under Section&nbsp;280G of the Code does not exceed $50,000, then no
Gross-Up Payment shall be made to Executive and the amounts payable under Section&nbsp;8(c) shall be
reduced so that the Payments, in the aggregate, are reduced to the Safe Harbor Amount. The &#147;Safe
Harbor Amount&#148; is the greatest amount of payments in the nature of compensation that are contingent
on a Change in Control for purposes of Section&nbsp;280G of the Code that could be paid to Executive
without giving rise to any Excise Tax. If the reduction of the amounts payable under Section&nbsp;8(c)
would not result in a reduction of the Payments to the Safe Harbor Amount, no amounts payable under
this Agreement shall be reduced pursuant hereto and a Gross-Up Payment shall be made to Executive.
