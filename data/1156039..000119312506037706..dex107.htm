establishes this WellPoint, Inc. Executive Severance Plan (&#147;<I>Plan</I>&#148;), effective as of January&nbsp;1, 2006 (&#147;Effective Date&#148;). The Plan is intended to protect key executive employees of WellPoint and its subsidiaries and
affiliates (collectively, the &#147;<I>Company</I>&#148;) against an involuntary loss of employment so as to attract and retain such employees, and motivate them to enhance the value of the Company. The Plan is intended to be an unfunded welfare
plan subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (&#147;ERISA&#148;); or to the extent it is a pension plan subject to ERISA, as an unfunded pension plan maintained primarily for the purpose of providing deferred
compensation to a select group of management or highly compensated employees. Words and phrases used with initial capitals in the Plan and not otherwise defined in the Plan have the meanings defined for them in Article 8. </FONT></P> <P
