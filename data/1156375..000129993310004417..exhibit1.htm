<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">2.7.1 <U>Adjustments by the Company</U>. The Company may permanently reduce the Aggregate
Commitment, in whole or in part ratably among the Banks, in proportion to the amounts of their
respective Commitments at any time upon written notice to the Administrative Agent;
<U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that, (i)&nbsp;subject to <U>Sections&nbsp;2.7.2</U> or <U>2.12</U>, the
amount of the Aggregate Commitment may not be reduced below the outstanding principal amount of the
Advance(s) and (ii)&nbsp;a notice of termination of the Aggregate Commitment delivered by the Company
may state that such notice is conditioned upon the effectiveness of other credit facilities, in
which case such notice may be revoked by the Company (by notice to the Administrative Agent on or
prior to the specified effective date) if such condition is not satisfied.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">2.7.2 <U>Adjustments by Banks for Accelerated Termination</U>. If the Commitment of a Bank
hereunder is terminated pursuant to <U>Section&nbsp;2.12</U>, the Company shall immediately notify
Administrative Agent in writing of such termination (<B>&#147;Accelerated Termination Notice&#148;</B>) and shall
state the amount of such terminating Bank&#146;s Commitment (<B>&#147;Terminated Commitment&#148;</B>) in the Accelerated
Termination Notice. Administrative Agent shall promptly provide a copy of the Accelerated
Termination Notice to each remaining Bank (each a <B>&#147;Non-Terminating Bank&#148;</B>). Each Non-Terminating
Bank shall notify the Company, in writing, on or before the fifth Business Day (second Business Day
in the event of a termination pursuant to Section&nbsp;2.12) after the date of the Accelerated
Termination Notice, if and by what amount such Bank is willing to increase its Commitment, which
amount shall be equal to all or some portion of the Terminated Commitment (each, a <B>&#147;2.7.2 Notice&#148;</B>).
Any Non-Terminating Bank that fails to so notify the Company on or before such fifth Business Day
(or second Business Day, as applicable), shall be deemed to have declined to increase its
Commitment. If offers to increase Commitments are made by two or more Non-Terminating Banks in an
aggregate amount greater than the aggregate amount of the Terminated Commitment, such
Non-Terminating Banks and the Company hereby agree that such offers shall be allocated as nearly as
possible in proportion to the aggregate amount of such offers, so that the aggregate amount thereof
will not exceed the amount of the Terminated Commitment. On or before the sixth Business Day (or
the third Business Day in the event of a termination pursuant to Section&nbsp;2.12) after the date of
the Accelerated Termination Notice, the Company shall notify Administrative Agent and each
Non-Terminating Bank of the amount by which each such Non-Terminating Bank&#146;s Commitment has been
increased, which amount shall not exceed the amount of such Non-Terminating Bank&#146;s offer to
increase its Commitment in such Bank&#146;s 2.7.2 Notice. All increases of Commitments by the Banks
under this Section&nbsp;2.7.2 shall become effective on the terminating Bank&#146;s Accelerated Termination
Date or on such later date on which the Company shall notify Administrative Agent and each
Non-Terminating Bank of the amount by which each such Non-Terminating Bank&#146;s Commitment has been
increased in accordance with this Section&nbsp;2.7.2 (<B>&#147;2.7.2 Effective Date&#148;</B>). The Company shall
promptly upon request deliver to each Bank whose Commitment has been increased pursuant to this
<U>Section&nbsp;2.7.2</U> a new Note reflecting such Bank&#146;s new Commitment amount and each such Bank
shall promptly, after repayment to such Bank of such Bank&#146;s ratable share of all Advances
outstanding on the 2.7.2 Effective Date, return to the Company such Bank&#146;s superseded Note, as
applicable. On the 2.7.2 Effective Date, the Commitments shall be adjusted to reflect any such
increases.

Concurrently with, or shortly following, or in lieu of, its making an Advance Request in respect of
Revolving Loans, the Company may also make an Advance Request in respect of Swingline Loans. An
Advance Request in respect of Swingline Loans shall specify the Swingline Banks being requested to
make Swingline Loans and the respective amounts thereof and, if such Swingline Loans are being
requested on the same day as any Revolving Loans, whether such Swingline Loans are to cover for any
Revolving Loans not made available to the Administrative Agent in a timely manner (any such
Swingline Loan, a <B>&#147;Covering Swingline Loan&#148;</B>) or are simply being requested in addition to such
Revolving Loans. If any Swingline Loans being requested are Covering Swingline Loans, the
Administrative Agent shall <U>first</U>, use the proceeds of the Revolving Loans timely made
available to it to fund the requested Advance as provided in <U>Section&nbsp;3.1(b)</U>, and
<U>second</U>, fund the remaining portion of the requested Advance, if any, with the proceeds made
available to it in respect of one or more Covering Swingline Loans, subject to <U>Section
3.1(c)</U>. For the avoidance of doubt, the provision of Swingline Loans by any Swingline Bank
shall be in addition to, and shall not relieve such Bank from its obligation to make Revolving
Loans ratably in proportion to the amount of, its Commitment.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(b)&nbsp;Immediately following the earlier of an Advance Request Confirmation or the delivery of an
Advance Request in accordance with <U>Section&nbsp;3.1(a)</U>, the Administrative Agent shall notify
each Bank in writing, by facsimile or email, of the Company&#146;s request for an Advance and such
Bank&#146;s pro rata share of the Advance (any such notice, a &#147;<B>Bank Notice</B>&#148;) and the Administrative
Agent and the Collateral Agent shall, as applicable, subject to the satisfaction of the applicable
conditions precedent set forth in <U>Article&nbsp;V</U>, not later than 5:45 p.m. (New York City time)
(i)&nbsp;determine the Market Value of the applicable Clearing Fund Collateral Pool or the Company
Collateral Pool, as applicable, and to determine the corresponding Borrowing Base, (ii)&nbsp;notify the
Company, by telephone, at the contact information provided in the Advance Request, of the
Collateral Agent&#146;s determination of the Market Value of the applicable Collateral Pool and the
corresponding Borrowing Base and whether such applicable Collateral Pool is sufficient for the
corresponding Borrowing Base to collateralize the Company&#146;s requested Advance (after giving effect
to any concurrent redesignation pursuant to <U>Section&nbsp;2.13</U>) and (iii)&nbsp;using the proceeds
provided by the Banks pursuant to <U>Section&nbsp;4.1</U>, or any additional proceeds that may be
provided on behalf of the Banks by the Administrative Agent as provided in this Agreement, make
available to the Company in immediately available funds the requested Advance (or, if such
Collateral Pool is not then sufficient to collateralize the requested Advance as required hereby,
the portion thereof that is so collateralized by such Collateral Pool). In the event that the
applicable Collateral Pool is not sufficient to so collateralize the requested Advance, the
Collateral Agent shall notify the Company thereof and the Company may post additional Collateral to
the applicable Collateral Pool within one Business Day of such notice (including, without
limitation, by withdrawing any Company Security in accordance with <U>Section&nbsp;2.9(b)</U> and
posting such Company Security as additional Collateral with respect to the applicable Clearing Fund
Collateral Pool); upon the posting of such additional Collateral to the applicable Collateral Pool,
the Administrative Agent shall make available to the Company a corresponding amount of the funds
deposited by the Banks in accordance with <U>Section&nbsp;4.1</U>. In the event that the Company fails
to post sufficient additional Collateral to the applicable Collateral Pool to collateralize the
requested Advance as required hereby within one Business Day following such notice from the
Collateral Agent of the insufficiency of the applicable Collateral Pool, the Administrative Agent
shall return any excess proceeds provided by the Banks to the Banks ratably in accordance with the
amounts funded by each Bank.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(c)&nbsp;If an Advance Request is made in respect of Covering Swingline Loans, (i)&nbsp;the portion
thereof made available to the Administrative Agent and not required to cover for Revolving Loans
shall be promptly returned to the applicable Swingline Banks on a pro rata basis in accordance with
the respective amounts made available by such Swingline Banks and (ii)&nbsp;the proceeds of Revolving
Loans subsequently made available to the Administrative Agent shall be distributed to such
Swingline Banks as a prepayment of the principal of such Covering Swingline Loans, with such
distribution to be made to such Swingline Banks on such a pro rata basis. Any Covering Swingline
Loans made available to the Administrative Agent, whether or not subsequently made available to the
Company, shall earn interest, payable by the Company, until the next Business Day at the Federal
Funds Rate plus 1.25% per annum. Each Swingline Lender that makes any Covering Swingline Loan
which is not made available to the Company and is promptly returned as contemplated above shall be
entitled to compensation for such Covering Swingline Loan from the Company as determined by such
Swingline Lender in accordance with its customary practices (<U>provided</U> that any such
compensation shall not exceed the interest payable in respect of any Advance until the next
Business Day pursuant to <U>Section&nbsp;3.3</U>); and any Covering Swingline Loan which is made
available to the Company shall earn interest, payable by the Company, in accordance with
<U>Section&nbsp;3.3</U>.

Advance shall be in the minimum amount of $10,000,000 (and in integral multiples of $250,000 if in
excess thereof), <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that any Advance may be in the aggregate amount
of the Excess Availability, as applicable to such Advance.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">Section&nbsp;3.3 <U>Interest</U>. Prior to its Loan Maturity Date, each Advance shall bear
interest at the Federal Funds Rate plus 1.25% per annum. Any Advance or other Obligation not paid
when due shall bear interest thereafter until paid in full at a rate per annum equal to the Federal
Funds Rate plus 3.25% per annum.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">Section&nbsp;3.4 <U>Method of Payment</U>.

of the Banks, at the address specified pursuant to <U>Article&nbsp;XIII</U> at any time up to 12:00
noon, New York City time, on the date when due. Any amount received after such time on any date
shall be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding Business Day for purposes of
calculating interest thereon. If any payment hereunder shall be due on a day that is not a
Business Day, the date for payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day, and, in
the case of any payment accruing interest, interest thereon shall be payable for the period of such
extension. All payments hereunder shall be made in lawful money of the United States of America.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(b)&nbsp;Except with respect to payments made to a Bank whose Commitment is terminated pursuant to
<U>Section&nbsp;2.12</U>, (A)&nbsp;all payments of principal of, and interest on, any Advance shall be made
by the Administrative Agent to the Banks ratably among the Banks, in proportion to the outstanding
principal amount of their respective Loans constituting part of such Advance and (B)&nbsp;all payments
of commitment fees and other amounts payable hereunder by the Administrative Agent to the Banks
shall be made to the Banks ratably among the Banks, in proportion to the amounts thereof owing to
them. If at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to the Administrative Agent
to pay fully all amounts of principal, interest and fees then due hereunder, such funds shall be
applied <U>first</U>, towards payment of all Obligations in respect of Swingline Loans,
<U>second</U>, towards payment of interest and fees then due in respect of Revolving Loans,
ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of interest and fees then
due to such parties, and <U>third</U>, towards payment of principal then due in respect of
Revolving Loans, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of
principal then due to such parties.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(c)&nbsp;If any Bank shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to
<U>Section&nbsp;2.14</U>, <U>4.1</U> or <U>4.3(b)</U>, then the Administrative Agent may, in its
discretion (notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof), apply any amounts thereafter received
by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Bank to satisfy such Bank&#146;s obligations under
such Sections until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid, but any such application shall
not affect the discharge of the Company of its obligations in respect of which such amounts were
received.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">Section&nbsp;3.5 <U>Notes; Telephonic Notices</U>. (a)&nbsp;Each Bank shall maintain in accordance
with its usual and customary practices an account or accounts evidencing the Loans made by such
Bank from time to time, including the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to such
Bank from time to time under this Agreement and the Loans. Any Bank may request that Loans made by
it be evidenced by one or more promissory notes (any such promissory note, a <B>&#147;Note&#148;</B>), and in such
event, the Company shall prepare, execute and deliver to such Bank a Note payable to such Bank or
to such Bank and its registered assigns substantially in the form of <U>Exhibit&nbsp;A</U> hereto.
Each Bank is hereby authorized to record the principal amount of each of its Loans and each
repayment on the schedule attached to its applicable Note, as applicable, or in its books and
records; <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that the failure to so record shall not affect the
Company&#146;s obligations in respect of any Loan. The Administrative Agent shall also maintain
accounts in which it will record (i)&nbsp;the amount of each Loan made hereunder and the information
with respect to such Loan described in <U>Section&nbsp;3.1(a)(ii)(A)</U>, (ii)&nbsp;the amount of any
principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable from the Company to each Bank
hereunder and (iii)&nbsp;the amount of any sum received by the Administrative Agent hereunder from the
Company and each Bank&#146;s share thereof. The entries maintained in the accounts maintained by the
Banks and the Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section shall be <I>prima facie </I>evidence (absent
manifest error) of the existence and amounts of the Obligations therein recorded; <U>provided</U>,
<U>however</U>, that the failure of the Administrative Agent or any Bank to maintain such accounts
or any error therein shall not in any manner affect the obligation of the Company to repay the
Loans in accordance with their terms. In the event the records maintained by a Bank conflict with
the records maintained by the Administrative Agent, the records maintained by the Administrative
Agent shall control.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(b)&nbsp;The Company hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to extend Advances (using the
proceeds provided by the Banks pursuant to <U>Section&nbsp;4.1</U> and otherwise in accordance with
<U>Section&nbsp;3.1</U>) based on telephonic notices made by any Persons the Administrative Agent in
good faith believes to be acting on behalf of the Company.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">Section&nbsp;3.6 <U>Interest Payment Dates; Interest Basis</U>. Interest accrued on each Advance
prior to the applicable Loan Maturity Date shall be payable to the Administrative Agent for the
benefit of the applicable Banks on the date on which the Advance is paid or prepaid, whether due to
acceleration or otherwise. Interest accrued on each Advance after its applicable Loan Maturity Date
shall be payable on demand. Interest and commitment fees shall be calculated for actual days
elapsed on the basis of a 360-day year.

ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">Section&nbsp;4.1 <U>Notice to and Payment by the Banks</U>. Promptly following the delivery of
any Bank Notice (and in any event, within 60 minutes following any delivery thereof, provided that
any delivery thereof shall occur by 5:00 p.m., New York City time), each Bank shall deposit in the
designated account of the Administrative Agent in immediately available funds the proceeds of such
Bank&#146;s pro rata share of the requested Advance.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">Section&nbsp;4.2 <U>Payment by Banks to the Administrative Agent</U>.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(a)&nbsp;Unless the Administrative Agent shall have been notified by a Bank that such Bank does not
intend to make available its share of an Advance, the Administrative Agent may assume that such
Bank has made or will make such payment and the Administrative Agent may in reliance upon such
assumption (but shall not be required to) make available to the Company the proceeds of the Loan to
be made by such Bank and, if any Bank has not in fact made such payment to the Administrative
Agent, such Bank shall, on demand, pay to the Administrative Agent the amount made available to the
Company attributable to such Bank together with interest thereon in respect of each day during the
period commencing on the date such amount was made available to the Company and ending on (but
excluding) the date such Bank pays such amount to the Administrative Agent at a rate per annum
equal to: (i)&nbsp;from the date the related advance was made by the Administrative Agent to the date
two (2)&nbsp;Business Days after payment by such Bank is due hereunder, the Federal Funds Effective Rate
for each such day and (ii)&nbsp;from the date two (2)&nbsp;Business Days after the date such payment is due
from such Bank to the date such payment is made by such Bank, the Federal Funds Rate in effect for
each such day plus 1.25%. If such amount is not received from such Bank by the Administrative Agent
immediately upon demand, the Company will, on demand, repay to the Administrative Agent the
proceeds of the Loan attributable to such Bank with interest thereon at a rate per annum equal to
the interest rate applicable to the relevant Loan.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(b)&nbsp;The failure of any Bank to make a payment to the Administrative Agent of the proceeds of
the Loan to be made by such Bank shall not relieve any other Bank of its obligation hereunder to
make payment to the Administrative Agent of the proceeds of a Loan, but no Bank shall be
responsible for the failure of any other Bank to make the payment required to be made by such other
Bank.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">Section&nbsp;4.3 <U>Distribution of Payments</U>.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(a)&nbsp;Whenever the Administrative Agent receives from, or on behalf of the Company, or any other
person or party, a payment of principal, interest or commitment fees or other amount payable
hereunder with respect to any of which the applicable Banks are entitled to receive a share, the
Administrative Agent shall promptly pay to such Banks, in lawful money of the United States of
America, the amount due each of such Banks as determined pursuant to this Agreement;
<U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that the amount of such distribution shall be adjusted to the
extent that amounts are owed by any Bank to the Administrative Agent or as otherwise provided by
<U>Sections&nbsp;2.14</U>, <U>3.4(c)</U> or <U>4.2</U> or <U>subsection (b)</U> hereof. If any
payment of principal, interest or commitment fees or other amount payable in connection with the
Loans is received from or on behalf of the Company by the Administrative Agent before 12:00 noon
(New York City time) on any Business Day, the Administrative Agent shall use reasonable efforts to
wire transfer the appropriate portion of the same to the applicable Banks that same Business Day,
but in any event shall wire the same to each of such Banks before the end of the next Business Day.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(b)&nbsp;Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Company prior to the
date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Banks hereunder
that the Company will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Company
has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may (but shall not be required to),
in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Banks the amount due. In such event, if the
Company has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Banks severally agrees to repay to the
Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Bank together with
interest thereon in respect of each day during the period commencing on the Business Day
immediately following the date of such demand and ending on (but excluding) the date of payment to
the Administrative Agent, at a rate per annum equal to: (i)&nbsp;from the Business Day immediately
following the date of such demand to the date two (2)&nbsp;Business Days after such date, the Federal
Funds Effective Rate for each such day and (ii)&nbsp;from the date two (2)&nbsp;Business Days after the
Business Day immediately following such demand to the date such payment is made by such Bank, the
Federal Funds Rate in effect for each such day plus 1.25%.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">Section&nbsp;4.4 <U>Rescission of Payments by the Company</U>. If all or part of any payment made
by the Company to Administrative Agent of principal, interest or commitment fees or other amount
payable in connection with the Loans is rescinded or must otherwise be returned for any reason and
if Administrative Agent has paid to any of the Banks such Bank&#146;s ratable share therein, such Bank
shall, upon telephone notice from Administrative Agent, forthwith pay to Administrative Agent, on
the date of such telephone notice (if notice is received by Administrative Agent at or prior to
12:00 noon, New York City time) or on the next Business Day (if notice is received by
Administrative Agent after 12:00 noon, New York City time), an amount equal to such Bank&#146;s ratable
interest in the amount that was rescinded or that must be so returned by Administrative Agent.
Administrative Agent shall promptly return to the Company, or to whomever shall be legally entitled
thereto pursuant to an order of a court of competent jurisdiction, each such amount (or any lesser
amount) that is received from each Bank. Administrative Agent shall have no obligation to the
Company for any amount that Administrative Agent paid to any Bank and that is not repaid by such
Bank, provided that Administrative Agent did in fact provide such Bank with the notice described
above to the effect that such payment was rescinded or must be returned.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(a)&nbsp;The Company and one or more Banks (each a <B>&#147;Principal Bank&#148;</B>) may, in the event that an
Agent shall become unable to fulfill any of its duties hereunder (as determined by the Company in
its reasonable discretion) or upon mutual agreement, from time to time request another Bank to act
as an additional agent for the purpose of administering and servicing the Loans of the Principal
Banks. Upon the acceptance of the offer to service by the proposed additional agent (which shall be
in the sole discretion of such proposed additional agent), such Bank shall be an additional agent
(<B>&#147;Additional Agent&#148;</B>) hereunder and as administrator of the Loans of the Principal Banks for which
it acts (and not as an agent, employee or fiduciary), shall be entitled to exercise all such powers
as are incidental to the powers to receive and collect funds from the Principal Banks and the
Company as provided for in this Agreement, and to take such other actions with respect to such
Loans as are provided hereby or as may be from time to time agreed by such Additional Agent and the
Principal Banks. In acting under this Agreement, Additional Agent agrees to exercise the same
degree of care in administering such Loans as it would use in managing its own loans;
<U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that this sentence shall not make Additional Agent a fiduciary
to any Principal Bank. The Principal Banks and the Company hereby agree and acknowledge that (i)&nbsp;in
performing the duties provided for in this Agreement, Additional Agent is acting solely for the
benefit of the Principal Banks and are in no way to be construed to be acting as agent for the
Company; and (ii)&nbsp;the servicing arrangement provided for herein is not intended to constitute, and
shall not be construed to establish, a partnership or joint venture between Additional Agent and
the Principal Banks, or between Additional Agent and the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the Company may, without the consent of any other Bank, appoint Bank of Montreal as Additional
Agent and upon such appointment, Bank of Montreal shall be an Additional Agent with the powers and
duties as set forth herein and shall serve in such capacity.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(b)&nbsp;The Company shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent of the appointment of an
Additional Agent. To the extent an Additional Agent will perform any function or duty currently
performed by the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent shall cease its performance of such
function or duty when the Company directs the Administrative Agent to cease such performance. An
Additional Agent shall not be deemed an agent or fiduciary of the Administrative Agent. In acting
in such capacity, an Additional Agent shall be deemed to be an &#147;Agent&#148; for the purposes of, and
shall benefit from the protections of, Article&nbsp;X.

THE AGENTS</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">Section&nbsp;10.1 <U>Declaration and Acceptance of Appointment; No Fiduciary Duties</U>. Subject
to the terms and conditions hereof, each Bank hereby appoints and authorizes JPMorgan Chase Bank,
N.A. as its administrative agent hereunder and under the other Loan Documents and to act as its
collateral agent hereunder and under each of the Collateral Documents and other Loan Documents,
with such powers as are expressly delegated to each Agent by the terms of this Agreement, the
Collateral Documents, and the other Loan Documents, together with such other powers as are
reasonably incidental thereto. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., by its execution hereof, hereby accepts
the appointment made under this <U>Section&nbsp;10.1</U>. Anything herein to the contrary
notwithstanding, none of the Bookrunners, Arrangers or Agents listed on the cover page hereof shall
have any powers, duties or responsibilities under this Agreement or any of the other Loan
Documents, except in its capacity, as applicable, as the Administrative Agent, a Lender or the
Collateral Agent hereunder. Neither the Administrative Agent nor the Collateral Agent shall have
any duties or responsibilities except those expressly set forth in this Agreement, the Collateral
Documents and the other Loan Documents, or be a trustee for, or have any fiduciary obligation to,
any Bank, and no implied covenants, functions, responsibilities, duties, obligations or liabilities
on the part of either the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent shall be read into this
Agreement or any other Loan Document or otherwise exist for such Agent, regardless of whether a
Default or an Unmatured Default shall have occurred and be continuing. In performing its functions
and duties hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, the Administrative Agent and the
Collateral Agent shall act (except as set forth in Section&nbsp;11.1(d), solely with respect to actions
by the Administrative Agent in respect of the Register) solely as agents for the Banks and do not
assume nor shall be deemed to have assumed any obligation or relationship of trust or agency with
or for the Company or any of its successors or assigns. Neither the Administrative Agent nor the
Collateral Agent shall be required to take any action that exposes such Agent to personal liability
or that is contrary to this Agreement, any other Loan Document or applicable law. The appointment
and authority of each Agent hereunder shall terminate upon the indefeasible payment in full of all
Obligations and the termination of the Commitments. Each Bank hereby authorizes the Collateral
Agent to execute each of the Collateral Documents on behalf of such Bank (the terms of which shall
be binding on such Bank) and to release any lien in any Collateral if such release is provided for
in any Loan Document or is otherwise consented to in accordance with <U>Section&nbsp;9.2</U>.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">Section&nbsp;10.2 <U>Reliance by Each Agent</U>. Each Agent shall in all cases be entitled to
rely, and shall be fully protected in relying, upon any notice, request, certificate, consent,
statement, instrument, document or other writing or communication believed by it in good faith to
be genuine and correct and to have been signed, sent or made by the proper Person or Persons. The
Administrative Agent shall be deemed not to have knowledge of any Default or Unmatured Default
unless and until written notice thereof is given to the Administrative Agent by the Company or a
Bank, and the Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or
inquire into (i)&nbsp;any statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection with this
Agreement or the other Loan Documents, (ii)&nbsp;the contents of any certificate, report or other
document delivered hereunder or in connection herewith, (iii)&nbsp;the performance or observance of any
of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth herein, (iv)&nbsp;the validity,
enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of this Agreement or any other agreement, instrument
or document, or (v)&nbsp;the satisfaction of any condition set forth in Article&nbsp;V or elsewhere herein,
other than to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to the Administrative
Agent. Except as expressly set forth herein, the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty to
disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to
Holdings, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that is communicated to or obtained by the bank
serving as Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity. Each Agent shall in all
cases be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any action under this Agreement or any
other Loan Document unless it shall first receive advice or concurrence of the Company or the
Required Banks (or, if required, all of the Banks), as applicable, as it deems appropriate and it
shall first be indemnified to its satisfaction by the Banks, <U>provided</U> that unless and until
such Agent shall have received such advice, such Agent may take or refrain from taking any action,
as such Agent shall deem advisable and in the best interests of the Banks. Each Agent shall in all
cases be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, in accordance with a request of
the Company or the Required Banks or all of the Banks, as applicable, and such request and any
action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding upon all the Banks.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">Section&nbsp;10.3 <U>Reimbursement and Indemnification</U>. The Banks severally agree to reimburse
and indemnify each Agent and its Related Parties ratably in proportion to the amounts of their
respective Commitments, to the extent not paid or reimbursed by the Company (i)&nbsp;for any amounts for
which such Agent, acting in its capacity as Agent, is entitled to reimbursement by the Company
hereunder or under any other Loan Document and (ii)&nbsp;for any other actual out-of-pocket expenses
incurred by such Agent, in its capacity as Agent and acting on behalf of the Banks, in connection
with the administration and enforcement of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, except in
each case, for any amounts or expenses that arise as a result of the gross negligence or willful
misconduct of such Agent.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">Section&nbsp;10.4 <U>Each Agent in its Individual Capacity</U>. Each Agent and its Affiliates may
make loans to, accept deposits from and generally engage in any kind of business with the Company
or any Affiliate of the Company as though such Agent were not an Agent hereunder. With respect to
the making of Loans pursuant to this Agreement, each Agent shall have the same rights and powers
under this Agreement in its individual capacity as any Bank and may exercise the same as though it
were not an Agent, and the terms <B>&#147;Bank,&#148; </B>and <B>&#147;Banks&#148; </B>shall include each Agent in its individual
capacity.

request of the Company in the event the Administrative Agent is a Defaulting Bank. The Required
Banks, with the consent of the Company (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld), may appoint
a successor Agent to succeed any Agent that resigns or is terminated pursuant to this <U>Section
10.5</U>. Subsequent to the effective date of such resignation or termination, the resigning or
terminated (as applicable) Agent shall have no further obligations in that capacity under this
Agreement. After any such Agent&#146;s resignation hereunder, the provisions of this <U>Article&nbsp;X</U>
and <U>Section&nbsp;11.9</U> shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring Agent, its
sub-agents and their respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be
taken by any of them while it was acting as Agent.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(b)&nbsp;If no successor Agent shall have been appointed by the Company and the Required Banks and
shall have accepted such appointment prior to the effective date of the resignation or termination
of the then acting Agent, the resigning or terminated Agent may appoint a successor Agent, which
shall be a bank or trust company organized under the laws of the United States of America or any
State thereof, having a combined capital and surplus of at least $500,000,000.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(c)&nbsp;Unless and until a successor Agent is appointed pursuant to Sections <U>10.5(a)</U> and
<U>10.5(b)</U> by the Company and the applicable Principal Banks acting together, (i)&nbsp;the services
performed by such Agent hereunder shall be performed by the individual Principal Banks and the
Company, each on its own behalf, and (ii)&nbsp;any payments or communications made by the Company to
such Agent hereunder shall be made directly to the applicable individual Principal Banks.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">Section&nbsp;10.6 <U>Non-Reliance Representation</U>. Each of the Banks acknowledges and
represents that it has, independently of and without reliance upon any Agent, and based solely upon
its own expertise (and the expertise of its agents and independent advisors, if any) and upon
financial statements and other information deemed appropriate by it, made its own credit analysis
of the Company and made its own decision to enter into this Agreement. Each of the Banks further
acknowledges and represents that it will, independently of and without reliance upon any Agent, and
based solely upon its own expertise (and the expertise of its agents and independent advisors, if
any) and upon such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to
make its own credit analysis of the Company and its own decisions with respect to this Agreement.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">Section&nbsp;10.7 <U>Exculpation</U>. No Agent nor any of its shareholders or Related Parties
shall be liable to the Banks, or any of them individually, for any obligation, undertaking, act or
judgment of the Company or any other Person, or for any error of judgment or any action taken or
omitted to be taken by such Agent (except and to the extent that the same arises from gross
negligence or willful misconduct on the part of such Agent), or be bound to ascertain or inquire as
to the performance or observance of any term of any of the Loan Documents. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, each Agent: (a)&nbsp;may rely on the advice and statements of legal counsel
selected by it (including, without limitation, counsel to the Company), independent accountants,
pricing services and other experts selected by such Agent and shall not be liable for any action
taken or omitted to be taken in good faith by it in accordance with the advice of such counsel,
accountants, pricing services or other experts; (b)&nbsp;makes no warranty or representation and shall
not be responsible for any warranty or representation made in or in connection with any of the Loan
Documents by any Person other than such Agent, or for the financial condition of the Company or any
other Person, or for the observance or performance of any obligations of the Company or any other
Person other than such Agent, or for the truth or accuracy of any document provided to such Agent
that such Agent has initially received from, or that such Agent has prepared based upon information

Documents, or (iii)&nbsp;the collectibility of the Loans.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">Section&nbsp;10.8 <U>Collateral Valuation</U>. The Collateral Agent shall monitor the Market
Value of the Collateral. On each Borrowing Date, the Collateral Agent shall determine the Market

valuation) securing the Loans to be made on such date. On each subsequent Business Day on which
there is an outstanding Advance, the Collateral Agent shall (i)&nbsp;to the extent any such Advance is a
Company Pool Loan, determine the Company Borrowing Base on and as of such date in accordance with
its usual and customary practices and (ii)&nbsp;to the extent any such Advance is a Clearing Fund Pool
Loan, determine the applicable Clearing Fund Borrowing Base on and as of such date in accordance
with its usual and customary practices, and, in each case, shall advise and notify (which may be by
telephone, provided that written confirmation thereof shall promptly follow) the Company, the
Administrative Agent and each Bank of each such determination.

In the event of any such sale by a Bank of participating interests to a Participant, such Bank&#146;s
obligations under this Agreement to the other parties to this Agreement shall remain unchanged,
such Bank shall remain solely responsible for the performance thereof and the Company and each
Agent shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Bank in connection with such Bank&#146;s

Bank shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment,
modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement and in no event shall a Bank that sells a
participating interest be obligated to the Participant to take or refrain from taking any action
hereunder or under any of the other Loan Documents except that such Bank may agree that it will
not, without the consent of such Participant, agree to (A)&nbsp;reduce the principal of, or interest

obligations under this Agreement (the <B>&#147;Participant Register&#148;</B>); <U>provided</U> that no Bank shall
have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register to any Person
(including the identity of any Participant or any information relating to a Participant&#146;s interest

that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such Commitment, Loan, or other obligation is
in registered form under Section&nbsp;5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations. The
entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Bank shall
treat each person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such
participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary.

without deduction for any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes; <U>provided</U> that if the Company
shall be required to deduct any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes from such payments, then (i)&nbsp;the
sum payable shall be increased by the amount (the <B>&#147;Additional Amount&#148;</B>) necessary so that after
making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums described in
this paragraph) such Bank receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such
deductions been made, (ii)&nbsp;the Company shall make such deductions and (iii)&nbsp;the Company shall pay
the full amount deducted to the relevant governmental authority in accordance with applicable law.
In addition, to the extent not paid in accordance with the preceding sentence, the Company shall
pay any Other Taxes to the relevant governmental authority in accordance with applicable law.

Indemnified Taxes and Other Taxes paid by such Bank, provided, however, that the Company shall not
be obligated to make payment to any Bank in respect of penalties, interest and other similar
liabilities attributable to such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes if such penalties, interest or
other similar liabilities are reasonably attributable to the gross negligence or willful misconduct
of such Bank.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(c)&nbsp;If a Bank shall become aware that it is entitled to claim a refund from a governmental
authority in respect of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes paid by the Company pursuant to this
<U>Section&nbsp;11.4</U>, including Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been
indemnified by the Company, or with respect to which the Company has paid Additional Amounts
pursuant hereto, it shall promptly notify the Company of the availability of such refund claim and,
if such Bank determines in good faith that making a claim for refund will not have a material
adverse effect on its taxes or business operations, shall, within 30&nbsp;days after receipt of a
request by the Company, make a claim to such governmental authority for such refund at the
Company&#146;s expense. If a Bank receives a refund in respect of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes
paid by the Company pursuant hereto, it shall within 30&nbsp;days from the date of such receipt pay over
such refund to the Company (but only to the extent of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes paid
pursuant to hereto, including indemnity payments made or Additional Amounts paid, by the Company

such refund), net of all out of pocket expenses of such Bank and without interest (other than
interest paid by the relevant governmental authority with respect to such refund). This Section
shall not be construed to require the Administrative Agent or any Bank to make available its tax
returns (or any other information relating to its taxes which it deems confidential) to the Company
or any other Person.

Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes on payments made to it by the Company, such Bank shall, upon the
request of the Company or the Administrative Agent, complete and deliver from time to time any
certificate, form or other document requested by the Company or the Administrative Agent, the
completion and delivery of which are a precondition to obtaining the benefit of such reduced rate
or exemption, <U>provided</U> that the taking of such action by such Bank, would not, in the
reasonable judgment of such Bank be disadvantageous or prejudicial to such Bank or inconsistent
with its internal policies or legal or regulatory restrictions. For any period with respect to
which a Bank has failed to provide any such certificate, form or other document requested by the
Company or the Administrative Agent, such Bank shall not be entitled to any payment under this

Company and the Administrative Agent, upon execution hereof (or, with respect to Persons becoming
Banks hereunder by assignment, upon execution of the relevant assignment agreement), two original
copies of United States Internal Revenue Service Form W-9 or any successor form, properly completed
and duly executed by such Bank, certifying that such Bank is exempt from United States backup
withholding Tax on payments of interest made under the Loan Documents and (ii)&nbsp;thereafter, at each
time when it is so reasonably requested in writing by the Company or the Administrative Agent or at
such time the Bank becomes aware of the invalidity or obsolescence of a previously delivered form,
deliver within a reasonable time two original copies of an updated Form W-9 or any successor form
thereto. Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a)&nbsp;and (b)&nbsp;above, the Company shall not be
required to indemnify a US Bank to the extent the obligation to pay such indemnity payment or
Additional Amounts would not have arisen but for a failure by such US Bank to comply with this
subsection (e), except (i)&nbsp;where such failure is a result of a change in law (including, but not
limited to, a change in the requirements set forth on Internal Revenue Service Form W-9 or any
change in interpretation of such requirements) occurring after such time the US Bank becomes a
party hereto or (ii)&nbsp;to the extent such Bank&#146;s assignor (if any) was entitled, at the time of
assignment, to receive additional amounts from the Company.

reduction of withholding Tax under the laws of the jurisdiction in which the Company is located, or
any treaty to which such jurisdiction is a party, with respect to payments under the Loan Documents
shall deliver to the Company and the Administrative Agent, upon execution hereof (or, with respect
to Persons becoming Banks hereunder by assignment, upon execution of the relevant assignment
agreement), such properly completed and duly executed documentation prescribed by applicable law or
reasonably requested by the Company or the Administrative Agent as will permit such payments to be
made without withholding or at a reduced rate, unless in the good faith opinion of the Foreign Bank
such documentation would expose the Foreign Bank to any material adverse consequences or risk or is
inconsistent with its internal policies or legal or regulatory restrictions, it being understood
that the completion of an Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN, W-8IMY or W-ECI by a Foreign Bank,
as applicable, as of the date of this Agreement, shall not be considered to be inconsistent with
such Foreign Bank&#146;s internal policies or legal or regulatory restrictions or expose such Foreign
Bank to a material adverse consequence. Such documentation shall be delivered by each Foreign Bank
on or before the date it becomes a Bank and on or before the date, if any, such Foreign Bank
changes its applicable lending office by designating a different lending office with respect to its
Loans (a <B>&#147;New Lending Office&#148;</B>). In addition, each Foreign Bank shall deliver such forms promptly
upon the obsolescence or invalidity of any form previously delivered by such Foreign Bank. If a
payment made to a Foreign Bank under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. Federal withholding
tax imposed by FATCA if such Foreign Bank fails to comply with the applicable reporting
requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section&nbsp;1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as
applicable), such Foreign Bank shall deliver to the Withholding Agent (i)&nbsp;a certification signed by
the chief financial officer, principal accounting officer, treasurer or controller and (ii)&nbsp;other
documentation reasonably requested by the Withholding Agent sufficient for the Withholding Agent to
comply with its obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Foreign Bank has complied with
such applicable reporting requirements. Each Agent and Bank (and, in the case of a Foreign Bank,
its lending office), represents that on the date hereof, payments made hereunder by the Company to
it would not be subject to United States federal withholding tax.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(g)&nbsp;Notwithstanding the provisions of <U>subsection (a)</U> and <U>(b)</U> above, the

any Foreign Bank, in respect of United States federal withholding tax pursuant to subsection (a)&nbsp;or
(b)&nbsp;above, (A)&nbsp;to the extent that the obligation to withhold amounts with respect to United States
federal withholding tax existed on the date such Foreign Bank became a Bank, became a party hereto
or otherwise acquired its interest herein or in the case of a Foreign Bank that after becoming a
party hereto changes its classification for United States federal income tax purposes under Section
7701 of the Code, United States federal withholding tax that exists on the date such change in
entity classification is effective, except to the extent that such Bank&#146;s assignor (if any) was
entitled, at the time of assignment, to receive additional amounts from the Company or such Bank
was entitled, immediately prior to such change in entity classification becoming effective, to
receive additional amounts from the Company; (B)&nbsp;with respect to a change by such Foreign Bank of
the jurisdiction in which it is organized, incorporated, controlled or managed, or in which it is
doing business, from the date such Foreign Bank changed such jurisdiction, but only to the extent
that such withholding tax exceeds any withholding tax that would have been imposed on such Bank had
it not changed the jurisdiction in which it is organized, incorporated, controlled or managed, or
in which it is doing business; or (C)&nbsp;to the extent that the obligation to pay such indemnity
payment or Additional Amounts would not have arisen but for a failure by such Foreign Bank to
comply with the provisions of <U>Section&nbsp;11.4(d) or (f)</U>.

required to pay any additional amount to any governmental authority for the account of any Bank
pursuant to this <U>Section&nbsp;11.4</U>, then such Bank shall use reasonable efforts to designate a
different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and
obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or Affiliates with the object of avoiding
or eliminating the amounts payable pursuant to this <U>Section&nbsp;11.4</U>, <U>provided</U> that
such designation or assignment shall be on such terms that such Bank and its lending office, in
such Bank&#146;s sole judgment, suffer no economic, legal, regulatory or other disadvantage and would
not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Bank. The Company hereby agrees to pay all reasonable
costs and expenses incurred by any Bank in connection with any such designation or assignment.

require such Bank to assign and delegate, without recourse, in accordance with and subject to the
restrictions contained in <U>Section&nbsp;11.1</U>, all of such Bank&#146;s interests, rights and

unpaid interest thereon, accrued and unpaid fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder from
the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the

such compensation or payments. A Bank shall not be required to make any such assignment and
delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Bank or otherwise, the circumstances
entitling the Company to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply.

thereof and methodology in calculating, each in reasonable detail) claimed under this <U>Section

under this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Bank&#146;s right to demand such compensation;
<U>provided</U> that the Company shall not be required to compensate any such Bank for any amounts
claimed under this Section that are incurred more than 90&nbsp;days prior to the date that such Bank

Federal law requires all financial institutions to obtain, verify, and record information that
identifies each Person that opens an account, including any deposit account, treasury management
account, loan, other extension of credit, or other financial services product. Accordingly, when
the Company opens an account, the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent and the Banks will ask
for the Company&#146;s name, tax identification number, business address, and other information that
will allow the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent and the Banks to identify the Company.
The Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent and the Banks may also ask to see the Company&#146;s
legal organizational documents or other identifying documents.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">Section&nbsp;12.1 <U>Setoff; Ratable Payments</U>.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(a)&nbsp;In addition to, and without limitation of, any rights of the Banks or Agents under
applicable law, if the Company becomes insolvent, however evidenced, or any Default occurs and is
continuing, any indebtedness or other obligation owing from any Bank or Agent to the Company
(including all account balances, whether provisional or final and whether or not collected or
available but excluding (x)&nbsp;any accounts designated as or representing &#147;customer segregated funds&#148;
accounts and (y)&nbsp;any accounts pledged to such Bank to secure an overdraft facility to ensure the
settlement of foreign currency futures and options contracts traded on the exchange of the Company,
CBOT, NYMEX or any other exchange in respect of which the Company has equivalent authority) may be
offset and applied toward the payment of the Obligations owing to such Bank or Agent, as the case
may be, whether or not the Obligations, or any part thereof, shall then be due.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(b)&nbsp;Subject to <U>Section&nbsp;2.11</U>, if any Bank, whether by setoff or otherwise, has payment
made to it upon any Loan in a greater proportion than that received by any other Bank upon any Loan
constituting a portion of the same Advance, such Bank shall distribute to the Administrative Agent
an amount equal to each of the other Banks&#146; pro rata share of such payment. Such payment shall be
distributed ratably between the Banks in proportion to each Bank&#146;s respective share of the total
Obligations outstanding under this Agreement. Any payment distributed pursuant to this
<U>subsection (b)</U> to the Administrative Agent shall be distributed by the Administrative Agent
to the applicable Banks in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(c)&nbsp;Subject to <U>Section&nbsp;2.11</U>, if any Bank, whether in connection with setoff or amounts
which might be subject to setoff or otherwise, receives collateral or other protection for any
category of its Obligations or such amounts which may be subject to setoff, in any case, in excess
of its pro rata share thereof, such Bank agrees, promptly upon demand, to take such action
necessary such that all Banks share in the benefits of such collateral ratably in proportion to
their Obligations of the same category. In case any such payment is disturbed by legal process, or
otherwise, appropriate further adjustments shall be made.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(d)&nbsp;The Company agrees that any Participant in a Loan may exercise setoff rights as provided
by <U>Section&nbsp;12.1(a)</U> as though it were a Bank with respect to its participating interest,
