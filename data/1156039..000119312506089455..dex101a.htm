applicable WellPoint Long-Term Disability Plan), or in the event that a Change In Control (as defined in the Plan) occurs before your employment is terminated, your option shall immediately become exercisable by you (or, in the case of your death,
your estate); provided, however, that in the event that you are a participant in or eligible to participate in the WellPoint, Inc. Executive Severance Plan, effective January&nbsp;1, 2006 (the &#147;Severance Plan&#148;), the exercisability of your

termination of employment after attaining age 55 with at least 10 completed years of service, your option will continue to become exercisable according to the schedule set forth above; provided that such option shall terminate on the five year
anniversary of the date of your Retirement; provided, further, that if your employment terminates due to your Retirement during calendar year 2006, your option shall be terminated on a pro-rata basis, measured by the number of months in 2006 during
which you were employed by WellPoint or its subsidiaries (e.g., if your Retirement occurs in September, 25% (or 3/12) of your option will be terminated), and the non-terminated portion of your option shall continue to become exercisable according to
the schedule set forth above; (c)&nbsp;if your employment terminates due to your death or Disability (as defined above), your option shall terminate on the five year anniversary of the date of such termination; (d)&nbsp;if your employment is
terminated for Cause (as defined above) even if on the date of your termination you have met the definition of Retirement or Disability (as defined above), then the portion of your option that has not been exercised will terminate; and (e)&nbsp;in
the event a Change In Control (as defined above) occurs before your employment is terminated, your option may be exercised by you during your employment through the Expiration Date; provided, however, that in the event that you are an Executive (as
defined by WellPoint) at the time of your termination, your option shall immediately terminate if you breach any provision of Section&nbsp;3.6 or 3.10 of the Severance Plan, regardless of whether you are then a participant in such Severance Plan, in
which case you shall be subject to the &#147;Return of Consideration&#148; provision contained in Section&nbsp;3.7 of the Severance Plan. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at no time may you exercise your option after the Expiration Date. </FONT></P>
