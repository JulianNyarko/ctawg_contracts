herein,  including  but  not  limited  to  registration  rights  on  the  Shares
underlying  the  SunTrust  Option Fee. The  SunTrust  obligation  will be deemed

annexed hereto and made a part hereof.  Subsequent to the date of this Agreement
and  immediately  upon the Advisor's  introduction  of an Advisor  Source to the
Company,  the Advisor shall amend Schedule A to include each additional  Advisor

this  Agreement  shall be declared by a court of  competent  jurisdiction  to be
invalid,  illegal  or  incapable  of being  enforced  in  whole or in part,  the

                  SECTION 14. ENTIRE AGREEMENT; MODIFICATION. This Agreement and
the schedule hereto contains the entire agreement of the parties relating to the
subject  matter  hereof,  and  the  parties  hereto  and  thereto  have  made no
agreements, representations or warranties relating to the subject matter of this
Agreement  which are not set forth herein.  No amendment or modification of this
Agreement  shall be valid  unless  made in  writing  and  signed  by each of the
parties hereto.

                  SECTION  15.  NON-WAIVER.  The  failure of any party to insist
upon the strict  performance  of any of the terms,  conditions and provisions of
this Agreement  shall not be construed as a waiver or  relinquishment  of future
compliance therewith,  and said terms, conditions and provisions shall remain in
full force and effect.  No waiver of any term or condition of this  Agreement on
the part of any party shall be effective for any purpose  whatsoever unless such
waiver is in writing and signed by such party.

                  SECTION  16.  REMEDIES  FOR  BREACH.  The  Advisor and Company
mutually  agree  that  any  breach  of  Sections  2,  4, 5, 6, 7, 8 or 9 of this
Agreement  by the  Advisor or the Company  may cause  irreparable  damage to the
other party and/or their  affiliates,  and that monetary damages alone would not
be adequate  and,  in the event of such breach or threat of breach,  the damaged
party  shall have,  in  addition to any and all  remedies at law and without the
posting  of a bond or  other  security,  the  right to an  injunction,  specific
performance  or other  equitable  relief  necessary  to prevent  or redress  the
violation of either party's  obligations under such Sections.  In the event that
an actual  proceeding  is  brought  in  equity to  enforce  such  Sections,  the
offending  party shall not urge as a defense that there is an adequate remedy at
law nor shall the damaged  party be prevented  from  seeking any other  remedies
that may be available to it. The defaulting  party shall pay all attorney's fees
and costs incurred by the other party in enforcing this Agreement.

                  SECTION 17. GOVERNING LAW. The parties hereto acknowledge that
the  transactions  contemplated by this Agreement bear a reasonable  relation to
the state of New York.  This  Agreement  shall be governed by, and construed and
interpreted  in  accordance  with,  the  internal  laws of the state of New York
without  regard to such state's  principles  of  conflicts of laws.  The parties
irrevocably and  unconditionally  agree that the exclusive place of jurisdiction
for any action, suit or proceeding  ("Actions") relating to this Agreement shall
be in the state  and/or  federal  courts  situate in the county and state of New
York.  Each party  irrevocably and  unconditionally  waives any objection it may
have to the venue of any Action brought in such courts or to the  convenience of
the forum.  Final  judgment in any such Action  shall be  conclusive  and may be
enforced in other  jurisdictions  by suit on the  judgment,  a certified or true
copy of which  shall be  conclusive  evidence  of the fact and the amount of any
indebtedness or liability of any party therein described.  Service of process in
any  Action  by any  party  may be made by  serving  a copy of the  summons  and
complaint,  in addition to any other relevant documents, by commercial overnight
courier to any other party at their address set forth in this Agreement.

                  SECTION  18.  HEADINGS.  The  headings  of  the  Sections  are
inserted  for   convenience   of  reference   only  and  shall  not  affect  any
interpretation of this Agreement.

                  SECTION 19.  COUNTERPARTS.  This  Agreement may be executed in
counterpart  signatures,  each of which shall be deemed an original,  but all of
which,  when taken together,  shall constitute one and the same  instrument,  it
being  understood that both parties need not sign the same  counterpart.  In the
event that any signature is delivered by facsimile transmission,  such signature
shall create a valid and binding  obligation of the party executing (or on whose
behalf such signature is executed) the same with the same force and effect as if
such facsimile signature page were an original thereof.
