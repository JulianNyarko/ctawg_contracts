<P align="right" style="font-size: 10pt"><FONT style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Exhibit&nbsp;10.3</B></FONT>



<P align="center" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>ISSUING AND PAYING AGENCY AGREEMENT</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; text-indent: 4%">This Agreement, dated as of August&nbsp;16, 2007, is by and between CME Group Inc. (the <B>&#147;Issuer&#148;</B>)
and JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association (<B>&#147;JPMorgan&#148;</B>).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">1.&nbsp;<B>APPOINTMENT AND ACCEPTANCE</B>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; text-indent: 4%">The Issuer hereby appoints JPMorgan as its issuing and paying agent in connection with the
issuance and payment of certain short-term promissory notes of the Issuer (the <B>&#147;Notes&#148;</B>), as further
described herein, and JPMorgan agrees to act as such agent upon the terms and conditions contained
in this Agreement.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">2.&nbsp;<B>COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAMS</B>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; text-indent: 4%">The Issuer may establish one or more commercial paper programs under this Agreement by
delivering to JPMorgan a completed program schedule (the <B>&#147;Program Schedule&#148;</B>), with respect to
<U>each</U> such program. JPMorgan has given the Issuer a copy of the current form of Program
Schedule and the Issuer shall complete and return its first Program Schedule to JPMorgan prior to
or simultaneously with the execution of this Agreement. In the event that any of the information
provided in, or attached to, a Program Schedule shall change, the Issuer shall promptly inform
JPMorgan of such change in writing.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">3.&nbsp;<B>NOTES</B>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; text-indent: 4%">All Notes issued by the Issuer under this Agreement shall be short-term promissory notes,
exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, as indicated
on the Program Schedules, and from applicable state securities laws. The Notes may be placed by
dealers (the <B>&#147;Dealers&#148;</B>) pursuant to Section&nbsp;4 hereof. Notes shall be issued in either certificated
or book-entry form.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">4.&nbsp;<B>AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVES</B>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; text-indent: 4%">The Issuer shall deliver to JPMorgan a duly adopted corporate resolution from the Issuer&#146;s
Board of Directors (or other governing body) authorizing the issuance of Notes under each program
established pursuant to this Agreement and a certificate of incumbency, with specimen signatures
attached, of those officers, employees and agents of the Issuer authorized to take certain actions
with respect to the Notes as provided in this Agreement (each such person is hereinafter referred
to as an <B>&#147;Authorized Representative&#148;</B>). Until JPMorgan receives any subsequent incumbency
certificates of the Issuer, JPMorgan shall be entitled to rely on the last incumbency certificate
delivered to it for the purpose of determining the Authorized Representatives. The Issuer
represents and warrants that each Authorized Representative may appoint other officers, employees
and agents of the Issuer (the <B>&#147;Delegates&#148;</B>), including without limitation any Dealers, to issue
instructions to JPMorgan under this Agreement, and take other actions on the Issuer&#146;s behalf
hereunder, provided that notice of the appointment of each Delegate is delivered to JPMorgan in
writing. Each such appointment shall remain in effect unless and until revoked by the Issuer in a
written notice to JPMorgan.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">5.&nbsp;<B>CERTIFICATED NOTES</B>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; text-indent: 4%">If and when the Issuer intends to issue certificated notes (<B>&#147;Certificated Notes&#148;</B>), the Issuer
and JPMorgan shall agree upon the form of such Notes. Thereafter, the Issuer shall from time to
time deliver to JPMorgan adequate supplies of Certificated Notes which will be in bearer form,
serially numbered, and shall be executed by the manual or facsimile signature of an Authorized
Representative. JPMorgan will acknowledge receipt of any supply of Certificated Notes received
from the Issuer, noting any exceptions to the shipping manifest or transmittal letter (if any), and
will hold the Certificated Notes in safekeeping for the Issuer in accordance with JPMorgan&#146;s
customary practices. JPMorgan shall not have any liability to the Issuer to determine by whom or
by what means a facsimile signature may have been affixed on Certificated Notes, or to determine
whether any facsimile or manual signature is genuine, if such facsimile or manual signature
resembles the specimen signature attached to the Issuer&#146;s certificate of incumbency with respect to
such Authorized Representative. Any Certificated Note bearing the manual or facsimile signature of
a person who is an Authorized Representative on the date such signature was affixed shall bind the
Issuer after completion thereof by JPMorgan, notwithstanding that such person shall have ceased to
hold his or her office on the date such Note is countersigned or delivered by JPMorgan.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">6.&nbsp;<B>BOOK-ENTRY NOTES</B>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; text-indent: 4%">The Issuer&#146;s book-entry notes (<B>&#147;Book-Entry Notes&#148;</B>) shall not be issued in physical form, but
their aggregate face amount shall be represented by a master note (the <B>&#147;Master Note&#148;</B>) in the form
of Exhibit&nbsp;A executed by the Issuer pursuant to the book-entry commercial paper program of The
Depository Trust Company (<B>&#147;DTC&#148;</B>). JPMorgan shall maintain the Master Note in safekeeping, in
accordance with its customary practices, on behalf of Cede &#038; Co., the registered owner thereof and
nominee of DTC. As long as Cede &#038; Co. is the registered owner of the Master Note, the beneficial
ownership interest therein shall be shown on, and the transfer of ownership thereof shall be
effected through, entries on the books maintained by DTC and the books of its direct and indirect
participants. The Master Note and the Book-Entry Notes shall be subject to DTC&#146;s rules and
procedures, as amended from time to time. JPMorgan shall not be liable or responsible for sending
transaction statements of any kind to DTC&#146;s participants or the beneficial owners of the Book-Entry
Notes, or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing the records of DTC or its participants with
respect to such Notes. In connection with DTC&#146;s program, the Issuer understands that as one of the
conditions of its participation therein, it shall be necessary for the Issuer and JPMorgan to enter
into a Letter of Representations, in the form of Exhibit&nbsp;B hereto, and for DTC to receive and
accept such Letter of Representations. In accordance with DTC&#146;s program, JPMorgan shall obtain
from the CUSIP Service Bureau a written list of CUSIP numbers for Issuer&#146;s Book-Entry Notes, and
JPMorgan shall deliver such list to DTC. The CUSIP Service Bureau shall bill the Issuer directly
for the fee or fees payable for the list of CUSIP numbers for the Issuer&#146;s Book-Entry Notes.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">7.&nbsp;<B>ISSUANCE INSTRUCTIONS TO JPMORGAN; PURCHASE PAYMENTS</B>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; text-indent: 4%">The Issuer understands that all instructions under this Agreement are to be directed to
JPMorgan&#146;s Commercial Paper Operations Department in accordance with Section&nbsp;18 hereof. JPMorgan
shall provide the Issuer, or, if applicable, the Issuer&#146;s Dealers, with access to JPMorgan&#146;s Money
Market Issuance System or other electronic means (collectively, the <B>&#147;System&#148;</B>) in order that
JPMorgan may receive electronic instructions for the issuance of Notes. Electronic instructions
must be transmitted in accordance with the procedures furnished by JPMorgan to the Issuer or its
Dealers in connection with the System. These transmissions shall be the equivalent to the giving
of a duly authorized written and signed instruction which JPMorgan may act upon without liability.
In the event that the System is inoperable at any time, an Authorized Representative or a Delegate
may deliver written, telephone or facsimile instructions to JPMorgan, which instructions shall be
verified in accordance with any security procedures agreed upon by the parties. JPMorgan shall
incur no liability to the Issuer in acting upon instructions believed by JPMorgan in good faith to
have been given by an Authorized Representative or a Delegate. In the event that a discrepancy
exists between a telephonic instruction and a written confirmation, the telephonic instruction will
be deemed the controlling and proper instruction. JPMorgan may electronically record any customary
conversations made pursuant to this Agreement, and the Issuer hereby consents to such recordings.
All issuance instructions regarding the Notes must be received by 1:00 P.M. New York time in order
for the Notes to be issued or delivered on the same day.

prepaid, the Issuer shall transmit, or cause to be transmitted, to the Account, prior to 2:00 P.M.
New York time on the same day, an amount of immediately available funds sufficient to pay the
aggregate principal amount of such Note and any applicable interest due. JPMorgan shall pay the

collected balance in such Account. Overdrafts shall be subject to JPMorgan&#146;s
established banking practices, including, without limitation, the imposition of
interest, funds usage charges and administrative fees. The Issuer shall repay any
such overdraft, fees and charges no later than the next business day, together

into this Agreement; and (ii)&nbsp;it will comply with all of its obligations and duties under this
Agreement. The Issuer further represents and agrees that each Note issued and distributed upon its
instruction pursuant to this Agreement shall constitute the Issuer&#146;s representation and warranty to
JPMorgan that such Note is a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Issuer, subject to
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency and similar laws affecting creditors&#146; rights generally and
subject, as to enforceability, to general principles of equity (regardless of whether enforcement
is sought in a proceeding in equity or at law), and that such Note is being issued in a transaction
which is exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and any applicable
state securities law.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">15.&nbsp;<B>DISCLAIMERS</B>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; text-indent: 4%">Neither JPMorgan nor its directors, officers, employees or agents shall be liable for any act
or omission under this Agreement except in the case of gross negligence or willful misconduct. IN
NO EVENT SHALL JPMORGAN BE LIABLE FOR SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL LOSS OR DAMAGE OF ANY KIND
WHATSOEVER (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOST PROFITS), EVEN IF JPMORGAN HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
LIKELIHOOD OF SUCH LOSS OR DAMAGE AND REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF ACTION. In no event shall JPMorgan
be considered negligent in consequence of complying with DTC&#146;s rules, regulations and procedures.
The duties and obligations of JPMorgan, its directors, officers, employees or agents shall be
determined by the express provisions of this Agreement and they shall not be liable except for the
performance of such duties and obligations as are specifically set forth herein and no implied
covenants shall be read into this Agreement against them. Neither JPMorgan nor its directors,
officers, employees or agents shall be required to ascertain whether any issuance or sale of any
Notes (or any amendment or termination of this Agreement) has been duly authorized or is in
compliance with any other agreement to which the Issuer is a party (whether or not JPMorgan is also
a party to such agreement).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">16.&nbsp;<B>INDEMNIFICATION</B>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; text-indent: 4%">The Issuer agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless JPMorgan, its directors, officers,
employees and agents (collectively, &#147;indemnitees&#148;) from and against any and all liabilities,
claims, losses, damages, penalties, reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys&#146;
fees and disbursements) suffered or incurred by or asserted or assessed against any indemnitee
arising in respect of this Agreement, except in respect of any indemnitee for any such liability,
claim, loss, damage, penalty, cost or expense resulting from the gross negligence or willful
misconduct of such indemnitee. This indemnity will survive the termination of this Agreement.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">To the Addressees listed on
<BR>
Schedule&nbsp;I hereto


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Ladies and Gentlemen:


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; text-indent: 8%">I am the General Counsel of CME Group Inc., a Delaware corporation (the &#147;Company&#148;), and, as
such, I am furnishing this opinion in connection with each of (i)&nbsp;that certain Commercial Paper
Dealer Agreement, dated as of August&nbsp;16, 2007 (the &#147;Lehman Dealer Agreement&#148;), between the Company,
as issuer, and Lehman Brothers Inc., as dealer (the &#147;Lehman Dealer&#148;), (ii)&nbsp;that certain Commercial
Paper Dealer Agreement, dated as of August&nbsp;16, 2007 (the &#147;Merrill Dealer Agreement&#148; and, together
with the Lehman Dealer Agreement, collectively, the &#147;Dealer Agreements&#148;), among the Company, as
issuer, and Merrill Lynch Money Markets Inc., as dealer for Notes (as defined in the Merrill Dealer
Agreement) with maturities up to 270&nbsp;days (&#147;MLMM&#148;), and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &#038; Smith
Incorporated, as dealer for Notes (as defined in the Merrill Dealer Agreement) with maturities over
270&nbsp;days (&#147;MLPF&#038;S&#148; and, together with MLMM, collectively, the &#147;Merrill Dealer&#148;), (iii)&nbsp;that certain
Issuing and Paying Agency Agreement, dated as of August&nbsp;16, 2007 (the &#147;Issuing and Paying Agency
Agreement&#148;), between the Company and JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association, as issuing and
paying agent (the &#147;Issuing and Paying Agent&#148;), and (iv)&nbsp;the Master Note dated August&nbsp;16, 2007 (the
&#147;Master Note&#148;). The Lehman Dealer Agreement, the Merrill Dealer Agreement, the Issuing and Paying
Agency Agreement and the Master Note shall hereafter be referred to collectively as the
&#147;Transaction Agreements.&#148; This opinion is being delivered pursuant to Section&nbsp;3.6 of each Dealer
Agreement.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; text-indent: 8%">In my examination, I have assumed the genuineness of all signatures, including endorsements,
the legal capacity and competency of natural persons, the authenticity of all documents submitted
to me as originals, the conformity to original documents of all documents submitted to us as
facsimile, electronic, certified or photostatic copies, and the authenticity of the originals of
such copies. When relevant facts were not independently established, I have relied upon statements
of governmental officials and upon representations made in or pursuant to the Transaction
Agreements, certificates of appropriate representatives of the Company.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; text-indent: 8%">In rendering the opinions set forth herein, I have examined and relied upon originals or
copies of the Transaction Agreements and such other documents as I have deemed necessary or
appropriate as a basis for the opinions set forth below.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; text-indent: 8%">Capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined herein shall have the same meanings
herein as ascribed thereto in the Dealer Agreements. As used herein, &#147;Applicable Laws&#148; means those
laws, rules and regulations which, in my experience, are normally applicable to transactions of the
type contemplated by the Transaction Agreements, without my having made any special investigation
as to the applicability of any specific law, rule or regulation, and which are not the subject of a
specific opinion herein referring expressly to a particular law or laws.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; text-indent: 8%">I am a member of the Bar of the State of Illinois and the foregoing opinions are limited to
matters involving the Federal laws of the United States of America and the General Corporation Law
of the State of Delaware and I do not express any opinion as to any other laws. I note that the
Transaction Agreements purport to be governed by the laws of the State of New York and I express no
opinion with respect to the laws of the State of New York.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; text-indent: 8%">Based upon the foregoing and subject to the limitations, qualifications, exceptions and
assumptions set forth herein, I am of the opinion that:


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; text-indent: 8%">1.&nbsp;The Company is a corporation validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
State of Delaware.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; text-indent: 8%">2.&nbsp;The Company has all the requisite corporate power and authority to execute, deliver and
perform its obligations under each of the Transaction Agreements. The execution and delivery of
each of the Transaction Agreements and the consummation by the Company of the transactions
contemplated thereby have been duly authorized by all requisite corporate action on the part of the
Company. Each of each Dealer Agreement and the Issuing and Paying Agency Agreement has been duly
executed and delivered by the Company.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; text-indent: 8%">3.&nbsp;In the event that an Illinois court were to apply the substantive laws of the State of
Illinois, notwithstanding the choice of law of the parties set forth in the Transaction Agreements,
and without regard to choice of law principles, each of the Transaction Agreements constitutes and,
in the case of the Notes, when issued in accordance with the Issuing and Paying Agency Agreement
and paid for by the purchasers thereof, will constitute, the valid and binding obligations of the
Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms under the Applicable Laws
of the State of Illinois.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; text-indent: 8%">4.&nbsp;The execution and delivery by the Company of each of the Transaction Agreements and the
performance by the Company of its obligations under each of the Transaction Agreements, each in
accordance with its terms, do not (i)&nbsp;conflict with the certificate of incorporation or by-laws of
the Company, (ii)&nbsp;constitute a violation of, or a default under any material agreements or
instruments known to me (after due inquiry) to which the Company is a party or by which it is bound
or to which it is subject or result in the creation or imposition of any lien upon any property of
the Company pursuant to the terms of any such material agreement or instrument or (iii)&nbsp;violate any
order, writ, injunction or decree known to me (after due inquiry) of any court or governmental
authority or agency applicable to the Company.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; text-indent: 8%">5.&nbsp;The offer, sale and delivery of the Notes in the manner contemplated by the Dealer
Agreements do not require registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or
qualification of any indenture under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (it being
understood that I express no opinion as to any subsequent resale of any Note); and the Notes will
rank at least pari passu with all other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness of the Company.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; text-indent: 8%">6.&nbsp;No consent, approval or authorization of, or filing, recording or registration with, any
governmental authority, which has not been obtained or taken and is not in full force and effect,
is required to authorize, or is required in connection with, the execution or delivery of any of
the Transaction Agreements by the Company or the enforceability of any of the Transaction
Agreements against the Company, except as may be required by the securities or Blue Sky laws of the
various states in connection with the offer and sale of the Notes.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; text-indent: 8%">7.&nbsp;To the best of my knowledge, except as disclosed in the Company&#146;s public filings with the
Securities and Exchange Commission, there is no litigation or governmental proceeding pending or
threatened against the Company or any of its subsidiaries which would have a material adverse
effect on the ability of the Company to perform its obligations under the Transaction Agreements.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; text-indent: 8%">8.&nbsp;The Company is not an &#147;investment company&#148; within the meaning of the Investment Company Act
of 1940, as amended.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; text-indent: 8%">My opinions are subject to the following assumptions and qualifications:


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; text-indent: 13%">(a)&nbsp;enforcement may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium or other similar laws affecting creditors&#146; rights generally and by general principles of
equity (regardless of whether enforcement is sought in equity or at law);


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; text-indent: 13%">(b)&nbsp;I have assumed that each of the Transaction Agreements constitutes the valid and binding
obligation of each party to such Transaction Agreement (other than the Company to the extent
expressly set forth herein) enforceable against such other party in accordance with its terms;


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; text-indent: 13%">(c)&nbsp;I express no opinion as to the effect on the opinions expressed herein of (i)&nbsp;the
compliance or non-compliance of any party (other than the Company to the extent expressly set forth
herein) to the Transaction Agreements with any state, federal or other laws or regulations
applicable to any of them or (ii)&nbsp;the legal or regulatory status or the nature of the business of
any party (other than the Company to the extent expressly set forth herein);


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; text-indent: 13%">(d)&nbsp;I express no opinion as to the enforceability of any rights to contribution or
indemnification provided for in the Transaction Agreements which are violative of the public policy
underlying any law, rule or regulation (including any federal or state securities law, rule or
regulation);


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; text-indent: 13%">(e)&nbsp;I express no opinion as to the applicability or effect of any fraudulent transfer,
preference or similar law on the Transaction Agreements or any transactions contemplated thereby;


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; text-indent: 13%">(f)&nbsp;I express no opinion on the enforceability of any provision in a Transaction Agreement
purporting to prohibit, restrict or condition the assignment of rights under such Transaction
Agreement to the extent such restriction on assignability is governed by the Uniform Commercial
Code;


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; text-indent: 13%">(g)&nbsp;I express no opinion as to the enforceability of any provision of any Transaction
Agreement to the extent it purports to waive any objection a person may have that a suit, action or
proceeding has been brought in an inconvenient forum or a forum lacking subject matter
jurisdiction;


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; text-indent: 13%">(h)&nbsp;for purposes of my opinion set forth in paragraph 5 above, I have assumed (a)&nbsp;the accuracy
of the representations and warranties and compliance with the agreements made by the Dealer in the
Dealer Agreements (b)&nbsp;compliance by the Dealer with the offering and transfer procedures and
restrictions required by the Dealer Agreements including, without limitation, the delivery to each
purchaser of the Notes of an offering memorandum containing a legend restricting offers, sales and
resales of the Notes in the form required by the Dealer Agreements and (c)&nbsp;the accuracy of the
representations and warranties made in accordance with such offering memorandum by the initial
purchasers of the Notes; and


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; text-indent: 13%">(i)&nbsp;I express no opinion as to the enforceability of Section&nbsp;7.3(a) of either Dealer
Agreement.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; text-indent: 13%">At the request of the Company, this opinion letter is, pursuant to Section&nbsp;3.6 of each Dealer
Agreement, provided to you by me in my capacity as in-house counsel of the Company and may not be
relied upon by any person for any purpose other than in connection with the transactions
contemplated by the Transaction Agreements without, in each instance, my prior written consent. No
opinion is implied or is to be inferred beyond the opinions expressly stated above. I assume no
obligation to update this letter for events, changes in law or circumstances occurring after the
date of this opinion.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; text-indent: 25%">Very truly yours,
