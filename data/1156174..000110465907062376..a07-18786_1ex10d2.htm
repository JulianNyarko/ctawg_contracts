Since the Actual Pooled Netback Ethanol Selling Price cannot be determined
before Renewable Products sells the Ethanol delivered by Member under this

Ethanol Selling Price with Actual Pooled Netback Ethanol Selling Price on a
monthly basis as provided below.</font></p>

At the end of each month, promptly after the information necessary to calculate
the Actual Pooled Netback Ethanol Selling Price becomes available; Renewable
Products will calculate the Actual Pooled Netback Ethanol Selling Price for the
preceding month. Renewable Products shall use the same methodology that is used
to calculate the Estimated Pooled Netback Ethanol Selling Price except that the
calculation shall be based on the Actual Delivered Ethanol Selling Price sold
during the month and the Actual Direct Distribution Expense incurred by
Renewable Products during the period. Renewable Products will provide that
Actual Pooled Netback Ethanol Selling Price to Member along with a summary of
the calculations used by Renewable Products to arrive at the Actual Pooled Netback
Ethanol Selling Price.</font></p>

Actual Selling Prices After Each Month</u>. Within ten (10) days after
Renewable Products provides Member with the Actual Pooled Netback Ethanol
Selling Price for the preceding month, the parties will reconcile the
difference between the Estimated Pooled Netback Ethanol Selling Price and the
Actual Pooled Netback Ethanol Selling Price for the preceding month, and the
difference between the estimated management fee and actual management fee for
the preceding month. If the Estimated Pooled Netback Ethanol Selling Price
exceeded the Actual Pooled Netback Ethanol Selling Price then Member will
refund to Renewable Products the overpayments that it previously received from
Renewable Products within ten (10) days after the completion of the
reconciliation. On the other hand, if the Estimated Pooled Netback Ethanol
Selling Price was less than the Actual Pooled Netback Ethanol Selling Price,
then Renewable Products will pay Member the additional amounts owed to Member
within ten (10) days after the completion of the actual and estimated selling
price reconciliation. A similar adjustment will be made to reconcile the actual
management fee to the estimated management fee. In lieu of Member directly
refunding any amounts to Renewable Products by separate payment and Renewable
Products directly refunding any amounts to Member by separate payment, under
this Section 7 the parties may offset the required amounts on their next
respective monthly payments.</font></p>
