value (the &#147;<U>Common Stock</U>&#148;). The exercise price per share of the Option will be
equal to the fair market value of a share of the Common Stock on the Effective Date.
The Board (or Compensation Committee thereof) will determine such fair market value in
its reasonable, good faith discretion (it being intended that, if the Common Stock is
then not publicly traded other than on the over-the-counter market, such fair market
value shall be based on the last sales price for a share of Common Stock as quoted on
the Pink Sheets unless such methodology does not, in the Board&#146;s reasonable, good faith
discretion, produce an accurate fair market value in the circumstances). The Option
will vest in substantially equal annual installments (equal installments except that
the installments will be rounded to produce vesting installments of whole share
increments) over the three-year period following the Effective Date. Except as
otherwise provided herein or in the Option Agreement referenced below, in each case,
the vesting of each installment of the Option is subject to the Executive&#146;s continued
employment by the Company through the respective vesting date. The maximum term of the
Option will be ten (10)&nbsp;years from the date of grant of the Option, subject to earlier
termination upon the termination of the Executive&#146;s employment with the Company, a
change in control of the Company and similar events. The Option shall be subject to
such further terms and conditions as set forth in a written stock option agreement to
be entered into by the Company and the Executive to evidence the Option (the

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2870. (a)&nbsp;Any provision in an employment agreement which provides that an employee shall
assign, or offer to assign, any of his or her rights in any invention to his or her employer shall
not apply to an invention that the employee developed entirely on his or her own time without using
the employer&#146;s equipment, supplies, facilities, or trade secret information except for those
inventions that either: (1)&nbsp;Relate at the time of conception or reduction to practice of the
invention to the employer&#146;s business, or actual or demonstrably anticipated research or development
of the employer; or (2)&nbsp;Result from any work performed by the employee for the employer; (b)&nbsp;To the
extent a provision in an employment agreement purports to require an employee to assign an
invention otherwise excluded from being required to be assigned under subdivision (a), the
provision is against the public policy of this state and is unenforceable.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2871. No employer shall require a provision made void and unenforceable by Section&nbsp;2870 as a
condition of employment or continued employment. Nothing in this article shall be construed to
forbid or restrict the right of an employer to provide in contracts of employment for disclosure,
provided that any such disclosures be received in confidence, of all of the employee&#146;s inventions
made solely or jointly with others during the term of his or her employment, a review process by
the employer to determine such issues as may arise, and for full title to certain patents and
inventions to be in the United States, as required by contracts between the employer and the United
States or any of its agencies.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2872. If an employment agreement entered into after January&nbsp;1, 1980, contains a provision requiring
the employee to assign or offer to assign any of his or her rights in any invention to his or her
employer, the employer must also, at the time the agreement is made, provide a written notification
to the employee that the agreement does not apply to an invention which qualifies fully under the
provisions of Section&nbsp;2870. In any suit or action arising thereunder, the burden of proof shall be
on the employee claiming the benefits of its provisions.&#148;

in Section&nbsp;1.4(d)) that any payment, distribution, transfer, or benefit by the Company, or a direct
or indirect subsidiary or affiliate of the Company, to or for the benefit of the Executive or the
Executive&#146;s dependents, heirs or beneficiaries (whether such payment, distribution, transfer,
benefit or other event occurs pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or otherwise in connection
with, or arising out of, the Executive&#146;s employment with the Company or a change in ownership or
effective control of the Company or a substantial portion of its assets, but determined without
regard to any additional payments required under this Exhibit&nbsp;D) (each a &#147;Payment&#148; and collectively
the &#147;Payments&#148;) is subject to the excise tax imposed by Section&nbsp;4999 of the Code, and any successor
provision or any comparable provision of state or local income tax law (collectively, &#147;Section
4999&#148;), or any interest, penalty or addition to tax is incurred by the Executive with respect to
such excise tax (such excise tax, together with any such interest, penalty, and addition to tax,
hereinafter collectively referred to as the &#147;Excise Tax&#148;), then the Payments shall be reduced (but
not below zero) so that the maximum amount of the Payments (after reduction) shall be one dollar
($1.00) less than the amount which would cause the Payments to be subject to the Excise Tax (the
&#147;Parachute Payment Threshold&#148;); provided, however, that in the event that the aggregate amount of
the Payments exceeds an amount equal to one hundred and ten percent (110%) of the Parachute Payment
Threshold, the Payments shall not be so reduced, and the Executive shall be entitled to a Gross-Up
Payment in accordance with Section&nbsp;1.2 below. If the amount of the Payments is less than or equal
to one hundred and ten percent (110%) of the Parachute Payment Threshold, the Payments shall be so
reduced, and unless the Executive shall have given prior written notice to the Company to
effectuate a reduction in the Payments if such a reduction is required, the Company shall reduce
the Payments by first reducing or eliminating any cash severance benefits, then by reducing or
eliminating any accelerated vesting of stock options, then by reducing or eliminating any
accelerated vesting of restricted stock, then by reducing or eliminating any other remaining
Payments. Any written notice by the Executive pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence shall
be given effect only if it would not constitute an acceleration, deferral or other change in
payment terms that is inconsistent with the requirements of (or the requirements for exemption from
) Section&nbsp;409A of the Code.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;As a result of the uncertainty in the application of Section&nbsp;4999 of the Code at the time
of the initial determination by the Accounting Firm (as such term is defined in Section&nbsp;1.3), it is
possible that Payments to the Executive which will not have been made by the Company pursuant to
Section&nbsp;1.1(a) should have been made. In such case, the Accounting Firm shall determine the amount
of such unpaid Payments and such amount shall be promptly paid by the Company to or for the benefit
of the Executive. It is also possible that a reduction in the Payments made pursuant to Section
1.1(a) will be less than the amount of the reduction which should have been made. In such case, the
Executive shall promptly repay the amount of such excess to the Company together with interest on
such amount (at the applicable federal rate provided for in Section 1274(d) of the Code) from the
date the reimbursable payment was

that if the sum of the amount by which the Payments were initially reduced and the amount of such
excess exceeds an amount equal to ten percent (10%) of the Parachute Payment Threshold, the
Executive shall be entitled to the full amount of the Payments (without any reduction pursuant to
this Section&nbsp;1.1) and a Gross-Up Payment in accordance with Section&nbsp;1.2.

does not apply because the amount of the Payments exceeds 110% of the Parachute Payment Threshold
as provided therein, then the Executive shall be entitled to receive an additional payment (a
&#147;Gross-Up Payment&#148;) equal to an amount such that after payment by the Executive of all taxes,
interest, penalties, additions to tax and costs imposed or incurred with respect to the Gross-Up
Payment (including, without limitation, any income and excise taxes imposed upon the Gross-Up
Payment), the Executive retains an amount of the Gross-Up Payment equal to the Excise Tax imposed
upon such Payments. This provision is intended to put the Executive in the same position as the
Executive would have been had no Excise Tax been imposed upon or incurred as a result of any
Payments.

of the initial determination by the Accounting Firm, it is possible that no Gross-Up Payment will
initially be made but that a Gross-Up Payment should have been made, or a Gross-Up Payment will
initially be made in an amount that is less than what should have been made (any of such events is
referred to as an &#147;Underpayment&#148;). It is also possible that a Gross-Up Payment will initially be
made in an amount that is greater than what should have been made (an &#147;Overpayment&#148;). The
determination of any Underpayment or Overpayment shall be made by the Accounting Firm in accordance
with Section&nbsp;1.3. In the event of an Underpayment, the amount of any such Underpayment shall be
paid to the Executive as an additional Gross-Up Payment. In the event of an Overpayment, the
Executive shall promptly pay to the Company the amount of such Overpayment together with interest
on such amount (at the applicable federal rate provided for in Section 1274(d) of the Code) for the
period commencing on the date of the Overpayment to the date of such payment by the Executive to
the Company. The Executive shall make such payment to the Company as soon as administratively
practicable after the Company notifies the Executive of (a)&nbsp;the Accounting Firm&#146;s determination
that an Overpayment was made and (b)&nbsp;the amount to be repaid.

underlying payment shall be paid as soon as practicable thereafter and in all events by the close
of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the tax to which it relates is remitted.

Executive shall be deemed to pay federal income taxes at the highest marginal rate of federal
individual income taxation in the calendar year in which the Gross-Up Payment is to be made. Such
highest marginal rate shall take into account the loss of itemized deductions by the Executive and
shall also include the Executive&#146;s share of the hospital insurance portion of FICA and state and
local income taxes at the highest marginal rate of individual income taxation in the state and

Service (or any successor thereof) or any state or local taxing authority (individually or
collectively, the &#147;Taxing Authority&#148;) that, if successful, would require the payment by the Company
of a Gross-Up Payment. Such notification shall be given as soon as practicable but no later than 30
days after the Executive receives written notice of such claim and shall apprise the Company of the
nature of such claim and the date on which such claim is requested to be paid; provided, however,
that failure by the Executive to give such notice within such 30-day period shall not result in a
waiver or forfeiture of any of the Executive&#146;s rights under this Exhibit&nbsp;D except to the extent of
actual damages suffered by the Company as a result of such failure. The Executive shall not pay
such claim prior to the expiration of the 15-day period following the date on which the Executive
gives such notice to the Company (or such shorter period ending on the date that any payment of
taxes, interest, penalties or additions to tax with respect to such claim is due). If the Company
notifies the Executive in writing prior to the expiration of such 15-day period (regardless of
whether such claim was earlier paid as contemplated by the preceding parenthetical) that it desires
to contest such claim, the Executive shall:

actions do not unreasonably interfere with or prejudice the Executive&#146;s disputes with the Taxing
Authority as to other issues, the Company shall control all proceedings taken in connection with
such contest and, in its reasonable discretion, may pursue or forego any and all administrative
appeals, proceedings, hearings and conferences with the Taxing Authority in respect of such claim
and may, at its or in their sole option, either direct the Executive to pay the tax, interest or
penalties claimed and sue for a refund or contest the claim in any permissible manner, and the
Executive agrees to prosecute such contest to a determination before any administrative tribunal,
in a court of initial jurisdiction and in one or more appellate courts, as the Company shall
determine; provided, however, that if the Company directs the Executive to pay such claim and sue
for a refund, the Company shall advance an amount equal to such payment to the Executive, on an
interest-free basis, and shall indemnify and hold the Executive harmless, on an after-tax basis,
from all taxes (including, without limitation, income and excise taxes), interest, penalties and
additions to tax imposed with respect to such advance or with respect to any imputed income with
respect to such advance, as any such amounts are incurred; and, further, provided, that any
extension of the statute of limitations relating to payment of taxes, interest, penalties or
additions to tax for the taxable year of the Executive with respect to which such contested amount
is claimed to be due is limited solely to such contested amount; and, provided, further, that any
settlement of any claim shall be reasonably acceptable to the Executive, and the Company&#146;s control
of the contest shall be limited to issues with respect to which a Gross-Up Payment would be payable
hereunder, and the Executive shall be entitled to settle or contest, as the case may be, any other
issue.

Company an amount equal to such refund (together with any interest paid or credited thereof after
taxes applicable thereto), net of any taxes (including, without limitation, any income or excise
taxes), interest, penalties or additions to tax and any other costs incurred by the Executive in
connection with such advance, after giving effect to such repayment. If, after the receipt by the
Executive of an amount advanced by the Company pursuant to Section&nbsp;1.4(a), it is finally determined
that the Executive is not entitled to any refund with respect to such claim, then such advance
shall be forgiven and shall not be required to be repaid and the amount of such advance shall be
treated as a Gross-Up Payment and shall offset, to the extent thereof, the amount of any Gross-Up
Payment otherwise required to be paid.
