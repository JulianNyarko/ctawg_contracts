Date</U>&#148;), the Company shall employ Executive as Chief Executive Officer of the Company.
Executive shall report directly to the Board of Directors of the Company (the &#147;<U>Board</U>&#148;).
Executive shall perform all the duties and obligations reasonably associated with the position of
Chief Executive Officer and consistent with the Bylaws of the Company as in effect from time to
time, subject to the supervision of the Board, and such other executive duties consistent with the
foregoing as are mutually agreed upon from time to time by Executive and the Board.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) <U>Board Membership</U>. Executive continued to serve as a member of the Board as of
the Commencement Date. Thereafter, at each annual meeting of the Company&#146;s stockholders during the
Term (as defined in Section&nbsp;2), the Board shall nominate Executive to serve as a member of the
Board. Executive&#146;s service as a member of the Board shall be subject to any required stockholder
approval. Upon the termination of Executive&#146;s employment for any reason, unless otherwise requested
by the Board, Executive shall tender his resignation from the Board (and all other positions held
at the Company and its affiliates) effective as of the end of Executive&#146;s employment, and Executive
shall, at the Board&#146;s request, execute and deliver any documents necessary to reflect his
resignation.

efforts to the rendition of services to the Company, and he shall use good faith efforts to

the Term, Executive agrees not to actively engage in any other employment, occupation, or
consulting activity for any direct or indirect remuneration without the prior approval of the
Board; <I>provided</I>, <I>however</I>, that (i)&nbsp;Executive may, without the approval of the Board, serve in any
capacity with any civic, educational, or community organization and (ii)&nbsp;Executive may, with the
prior approval of the Board (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld), serve as a
director of any company that is not directly or indirectly in competition with the Company, in each
case as long as such activities or service do not materially interfere with his duties and
obligations to the Company.

Executive&#146;s employment under this Agreement shall be extended automatically for one additional year

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">terminate Executive&#146;s employment with Cause upon written notice to Executive of the alleged
act or omission constituting Cause, which notice shall set forth in reasonable detail the reason or
reasons that the Board believes Executive is to be terminated for Cause. For purposes of this
Agreement, &#147;<U>Cause</U>&#148; means the occurrence of any one or more of the following events: (i)
any willful act or willful omission (other than as a result of Disability) that represents a breach
of any of the terms of this Agreement to the material detriment of the Company; (ii)&nbsp;Executive&#146;s
conviction of, or plea of <I>nolo contendere </I>to, a felony (other than a traffic infraction); or (iii)
the commission by Executive of a material act of fraud, theft or dishonesty against the Company.
If an event described in clause (i)&nbsp;of the preceding sentence is reasonably capable of being cured,
(A)&nbsp;Executive shall be given 45&nbsp;days from the date of such notice to effect a cure of such alleged
act or omission constituting Cause which, upon such cure to the reasonable satisfaction of the
Board, shall no longer constitute a basis for Cause, and (B)&nbsp;Executive shall be given an
opportunity to make a presentation to the Board (accompanied by counsel or other representative, if
Executive so desires) at a meeting of the Board held promptly following such 45-day cure period if
the Board intends to determine that no cure has occurred. At or following such meeting, the Board
shall determine whether or not to terminate Executive with Cause and shall notify Executive of its
determination and the effective date of such termination (which date may be no earlier than the
date of the aforementioned Board meeting). For purposes hereof, no act or omission shall be deemed
&#147;willful&#148; if it was done with a good faith belief that it was in the best interests of the Company.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) <U>Termination by Executive With Good Reason</U>. Executive may terminate Executive&#146;s
employment with the Company with Good Reason upon written notice to the Company of the alleged act
or omission constituting Good Reason, which notice shall set forth in reasonable detail the reason
or reasons that Executive believes his employment is to be terminated for Good Reason. For
purposes of this Agreement, &#147;<U>Good Reason</U>&#148; means, without Executive&#146;s written consent, (i)&nbsp;a
reduction of Executive&#146;s Base Salary, (ii)&nbsp;a reduction in Executive&#146;s annual incentive bonus target
below Executive&#146;s initial annual incentive bonus target, (iii)&nbsp;Executive is no longer the Chief
Executive Officer of (A)&nbsp;the Company, or (B)&nbsp;in the event of a Change of Control, the successor to
the Company&#146;s business or assets, (iv)&nbsp;Executive is no longer serving on (A)&nbsp;the Board or (B)&nbsp;in
the event of a Change of Control, the board of directors or similar governing body of successor to
the Company&#146;s business or assets, except in each case on account of removal from the Board for
cause pursuant to the vote of the stockholders of the Company or due to Executive&#146;s resignation
from, or refusal to stand for reelection to, the Board, (v)&nbsp;any material breach by the Company of
any of the material terms of this Agreement, or (vi)&nbsp;during the one-year period following a Change
of Control, Executive is required to relocate his place of employment to a location that is more
than 35 miles from the location of the Company&#146;s headquarters as of the date first set forth above;
<I>provided</I>, <I>however</I>, that for any of the foregoing to constitute Good Reason, Executive must provide
written notification of such event or condition constituting Good Reason within 90&nbsp;days after
Executive knows of the occurrence of any such event or condition, and the Company shall have 60
days from the date of receipt of such written notice to effect a cure of the event or condition
constituting Good Reason, and, upon cure thereof by the Company, such event or condition shall no
longer constitute Good Reason.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) <U>Termination by the Company Without Cause or by Executive Without Good Reason</U>.
The Company may terminate Executive&#146;s employment without Cause at any time upon 60&nbsp;days&#146; written
notice to Executive. Executive may terminate Executive&#146;s employment without Good Reason upon 60
days&#146; written notice to the Company. Nonrenewal of the Term by the Company shall not constitute a
termination without Cause, except that notice of nonrenewal by the Company shall constitute
termination without Cause if the notice of nonrenewal is provided to Executive during the period
commencing on (i)&nbsp;the earlier of (x)&nbsp;the date that the Board recommends to the Company&#146;s
stockholders approval of a transaction or series of transactions that would effect a Change of
Control, (y)&nbsp;the date that the Board approves the execution and delivery by the Company of a
definitive agreement for a transaction or series of transactions that would effect a Change of
Control, or (z)&nbsp;a Change of Control, and continuing through (ii)&nbsp;the close of business on the day
following a Change of Control (such period, the &#147;<U>Change of Control Period</U>&#148;).

exercisable until the earlier of the expiration of such Subsequent Equity Awards or the

its sole discretion to accelerate vesting of additional portions of any Equity Awards. For
purposes of the preceding sentence, any Subsequent Equity Award that has &#147;cliff vesting&#148;
(i.e., other than pro rata annual vesting) shall become vested pro rata based on the total
vesting period of such Subsequent Equity Award and the period commencing on the grant date
of such Subsequent Equity Award and the first anniversary of the Termination Date.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event Executive&#146;s employment is terminated by the
Company without Cause or by Executive with Good Reason during the Change of Control Period
or prior to the first anniversary of a Change of Control, all Equity Awards shall become

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Section&nbsp;4999 of the Code, Executive shall be entitled to receive an additional payment (a
&#147;<U>Gross-Up Payment</U>&#148;) in an amount such that, after payment by Executive of all taxes (and
any interest or penalties imposed with respect to such taxes), including any income and employment
taxes and Excise Taxes imposed upon the Gross-Up Payment, Executive retains an amount of the
Gross-Up Payment equal to the Excise Tax imposed upon such Payments. Notwithstanding the foregoing
provisions of this Section, if it shall be determined that Executive is entitled to a Gross-Up
Payment, but that the portion of the Payments that would be treated as &#147;parachute payments&#148; under
Section&nbsp;280G of the Code does not exceed $50,000, then no Gross-Up Payment shall be made to
Executive and the amounts payable under Section 8(c) shall be reduced so that the Payments, in the
aggregate, are reduced to the Safe Harbor Amount. The &#147;Safe Harbor Amount&#148; is the greatest amount
of payments in the nature of compensation that are contingent on a Change in Control for purposes
of Section&nbsp;280G of the Code that could be paid to Executive without giving rise to any Excise Tax.
If the reduction of the amounts payable under Section 8(c) would not result in a reduction of the
Payments to the Safe Harbor Amount, no amounts payable under this Agreement shall be reduced
pursuant hereto and a Gross-Up Payment shall be made to Executive.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;All determinations required to be made under this Section&nbsp;10, including whether a
Gross-Up Payment or reduction is required and the amount of any Gross-Up Payment or reductions of
Payments, shall be made by a nationally recognized certified public accounting firm that shall be
designated by the Company and reasonably acceptable to Executive (the &#147;<U>Accounting Firm</U>&#148;).
The Accounting Firm shall provide detailed supporting calculations both to the Company and
Executive within 15 business days of the receipt of notice from Executive that there has been a
Payment or such earlier time as is requested by the Company or Executive. All fees and expenses of
the Accounting Firm shall be borne solely by the Company. Any Gross-Up Payment, as determined
pursuant to this Section, shall be paid by the Company to Executive within five (5)&nbsp;business days
of the receipt of the Accounting Firm&#146;s determination and in any event not later than the last day
of the calendar year after the calendar year in which the applicable Excise Tax is paid. If the
Accounting Firm determines that no Excise Tax is payable by Executive or that a reduction is
required, it shall so indicate to Executive in writing.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;Any determination by the Accounting Firm shall be binding upon the Company and Executive
(absent manifest error), <I>provided that</I>, in the event that Executive&#146;s tax advisor delivers to the
Accounting Firm and the Company a written opinion that the actual Excise Tax payable by Executive
is greater than the Excise Tax amount initially determined by the Accounting Firm by reason of (i)
manifest error, (ii)&nbsp;any Payment the existence or amount of which could not have been, or was not,
determined or known at the time the Excise Tax was initially determined or (iii)&nbsp;any determination,
claim or assertion made by any tax authority that the actual Excise Tax is greater than the amount
initially determined by the Accounting Firm, then, in any such case, the Accounting Firm shall
recalculate the amount of the Excise Tax and any required (or additional) Gross-Up Payment. Any
such additional calculation or determination shall be performed consistent with this Section&nbsp;10.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)&nbsp;Executive shall notify the Company in writing of any written claim by the Internal
Revenue Service that, if successful, would require the payment by the Company of a Gross-Up
Payment. Executive shall apprise the Company of the nature of such claim and the date on which
such claim is requested to be paid. Executive shall not pay such claim prior to the expiration of
the 30-day period following the date on which Executive gives such notice to the Company (or such
shorter period ending on the date that any payment of taxes with respect to such claim is due). If
the Company notifies Executive in writing prior to the expiration of such period that the Company
desires to contest such claim, Executive shall (i)&nbsp;give the Company any information reasonably
requested by the Company relating to such claim, (ii)&nbsp;take such action in connection with
contesting such claim as the Company shall reasonably request in writing from time to time,
including accepting legal representation with respect to such claim by an attorney reasonably
selected by the Company, (iii)&nbsp;cooperate with the Company in good faith in order effectively to
contest such claim, and (iv)&nbsp;permit the Company to participate in any proceedings relating to such
claim; <I>provided, however</I>, that (A)&nbsp;the Company shall bear and pay directly

thereafter. If the arbitrator is not appointed by the appointing authority within 30&nbsp;days following
such reference, any party may apply to any court within the District of Columbia for an order
appointing an arbitrator qualified as set forth below.

individual members in various industries, including without limitation such services as
short-answer or custom research on demand, multiple client or syndicated studies, benchmarking
data and databases and conferences, seminars, training and education. In order to remain
competitive in this business, the company must protect its goodwill, its base of members and
prospective members, its employees, its confidential and proprietary information, and the work
product of its employees. The Company has offered employment or continued employment to the
Employee. During the course of employment, the Employee will develop important contacts with
the members and prospective members of the Company, and will also become aware of certain
methods, practices, information and procedures with which the Company conducts its business.
The employee may also prepare studies and other written materials using the Company&#146;s
resources.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the recitals above, initial and/or continued
employment and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are
acknowledged, the parties agree as follows:
</DIV>
<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">1. <U><B>Covenant Not to Compete</B></U>: (a)&nbsp;If the Employee&#146;s employment is terminated by the Company
with or
without Cause, or if the Employee voluntarily resigns, the Employee shall not, directly or
indirectly, either individually or
as a stockholder, director, officer, partner, consultant, owner, employee, agent, or in any other
capacity, for a period of
two (2)&nbsp;years following such termination, (i)&nbsp;provide &#147;Company Services&#148; within a one hundred (100)
mile radius of any
city in the United States or in any foreign country in which the Company has an office or a member
or in which the
Company had a member or directly or indirectly solicited a prospective member at any time during
the two-year period
prior to the termination of the Employee&#146;s employment; or (ii)&nbsp;solicit or offer to provide or
provide &#147;Company Services&#148;
to any person or entity who was a member of the Company or was directly or indirectly solicited to
be a member of the

or substantially
similar type provided by the Company or (ee)&nbsp;assisting individual members in implementing
strategies arising from
multiple client or syndicated studies of the type described in (bb)&nbsp;above, or (ff)&nbsp;providing any
other services or products
not described in (aa)&nbsp;through (ee)&nbsp;above that the Company or its affiliates is providing, has
provided or proposes to
provide as of the date of the Employee&#146;s termination; where any of the foregoing services described
in (aa)&nbsp;through (ff)
above are provided to any of the following: physicians, hospitals, health plans, pharmaceutical
companies, insurance companies, managed care companies, commercial banks, brokerage houses, mutual fund companies
or Fortune 1000 companies. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Employee may upon termination in
the situations described above (i)&nbsp;work as a consultant or for a consulting firm, provided
he/she complies with all of the provisions of this Section&nbsp;1(a),
and (ii)&nbsp;be employed fay The
Corporate Executive Board Company, a Delaware corporation (&#147;CEB&#148;), if such employment is
permitted and consistent with the terms of any noncompetition agreement between the Company
and CEB (the &#147;Other Noncompetition Agreement&#148;). The Company may release the Employee from some
or all of the restrictions in this section only in a written instrument signed by the Employee
and the Chairman of the Company. For purposes of this Agreement, so long as the Other
Noncompetition Agreement is in effect, CEB shall be deemed to be an affiliate of the Company.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">For the purposes of this Section l(a), &#147;Cause&#148; for termination shall mean the commission of an

violation of any applicable laws, rules or regulations in connection with or during
performance of work; or any other act(s) or omissions to act which the Company deems to
constitute reason for termination in its judgment.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)The Employee agrees that the restrictions imposed upon him/her by the provisions of
this section are fair and reasonable considering the nature of the Company&#146;s business, and are
reasonably required for the protection of the Company. The Employee further agrees that the
provisions of Section l(a) relating to areas of restriction, member limitations and time
periods of restriction were specifically discussed with and are acceptable to the Employee.
Nevertheless, to the extent that these restrictions exceed the maximum areas of restriction,
which a court of competent jurisdiction would enforce, such restrictions shall be modified by
such court to be the maximum restrictions which such court would enforce. If any other part of
Section&nbsp;1 (a)&nbsp;is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining parts shall nevertheless
continue to be valid and enforceable as though the unenforceable portions were absent.
</DIV>
<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">2. <U><B>Solicitation of Employees</B></U>: The Employee agrees that during the term of his/her
employment, and for a
period of two (2)&nbsp;years after termination of such employment for any reason, he/she shall not,
except in the course of
his/her duties for the Company, directly or indirectly induce or attempt to induce or otherwise
counsel, advise, ask or
encourage any person who at the time is a current employee of the Company or its affiliates, or who left such employ
within the preceding six months, to leave the employ of the Company or to accept employment with another employer
besides the Company or as an independent contractor.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">3. <u><B>Employment Statement</B></u>: The Employee also agrees to abide by the restrictions imposed in the
&#147;Employment Statement&#148; addressing confidential information and return of company property,
which is attached hereto and incorporated by reference herein.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">4. <U><B>Miscellaneous</B></U>: If any provision of this Agreement shall be determined, by a court
having jurisdiction, to be
unenforceable, the remainder of this Agreement shall not be affected but shall continue in full
force and effect as though
such unenforceable provision were not originally a part of this Agreement. The Employee
acknowledges that a breach
of any of the provisions of this Agreement may result in continuing and irreparable damages to the
Company for which
there may be no adequate remedy at law and that the Company in addition to all other relief
available to it shall be
entitled to the issuance of injunctive relief restraining the Employee from committing or
continuing to commit any
breach of this Agreement. If the Company is the prevailing party in any action for breach of this
Agreement, the
Employee shall reimburse the Company for its reasonable attorneys&#146; fees and costs incurred in such
action. This
Agreement shall be construed in accordance with and governed by the laws of the District of
Columbia, irrespective of
the principles of conflicts of law therein. This Agreement does not constitute a contract of
employment for a definite period of time. Either party may terminate the employment relationship with or without cause at
any time for any lawful
reason. The provisions of this Agreement shall survive the termination of the employment
relationship between the Company and the Employee. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
shall inure to the benefit of the parties and their respective successors and assigns.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Employee shall not assign his/her obligations under this
Agreement without the express written consent of the Company and its successors and assigns.

Section&nbsp;1, Executive, on his own behalf and on behalf of his heirs, executors, administrators,
attorneys and assigns, hereby unconditionally and irrevocably releases, waives and forever
discharges the Company and each of its affiliates, parents, successors, predecessors, and the
subsidiaries, directors, owners, members, shareholders, officers, agents, and employees of the
Company and its affiliates, parents, successors, predecessors, and subsidiaries (collectively, all
of the foregoing are referred to as the &#147;<U>Employer</U>&#148;), from any and all causes of action,
claims and damages, including attorneys&#146; fees, whether known or unknown, foreseen or unforeseen,
presently asserted or otherwise arising through the date of his signing of this Release, concerning
his employment or separation from employment. Subject to the last sentence of the first paragraph
of this Section&nbsp;1, this Release includes, but is not limited to, any payments, benefits or damages
arising under any federal law (including, but not limited to, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of
1964, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of
1974, the Americans with Disabilities Act, Executive Order 11246, the Family and Medical Leave Act,

workforce reductions); and any claim arising under any common law principle or public policy,
including, but not limited to, all suits in tort or contract, such as wrongful termination,
defamation, emotional distress, invasion of privacy or loss of consortium. Notwithstanding any
other provision of this Release to the contrary, this Release does not encompass, and Executive
does not release, waive or discharge, the obligations of the Company (a)&nbsp;to make the payments and
provide the other benefits contemplated by the Employment Agreement, or (b)&nbsp;under any restricted

Equal Employment Opportunity Commission) pursue any claim on his behalf arising out of or related
to his employment with and/or separation from employment with the Company.
