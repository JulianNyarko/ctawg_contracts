term is defined in the Shareholders Agreement) an annual monitoring fee in respect of each fiscal year from and including fiscal 2006 in an amount equal to the greater of $6.25 million or 1.25% of Adjusted EBITDA for such fiscal year (the
&#147;<I><U>Monitoring Fee</U></I>&#148;). A payment of $6.25 million in respect of the Monitoring Fee for fiscal 2006 shall be paid on July&nbsp;3, 2006 at or prior to the time of the Merger, and Intelsat Bermuda will pay the Sponsors (other than a
Sponsor affiliated with a Non-Eligible Investor Group) an amount equal to the excess, if any, of 1.25% of Adjusted EBITDA for fiscal 2006 over $6.25 million, such amount to be paid promptly upon the determination of Adjusted EBITDA for fiscal 2006.
On the first business day on or after January&nbsp;1 of each fiscal year, commencing on January&nbsp;2, 2007, Intelsat Bermuda will make a payment of $6.25 million in respect of the Monitoring Fees in respect of such fiscal year, and will promptly

fiscal year; <U>provided</U>, that no portion of the Lump Sum Payment shall be payable to any Sponsor if on the Notice Date the Investors affiliated with such Sponsor do not collectively own any beneficial economic interest in the Parent. Each
Sponsor, other than a Sponsor affiliated with an Investor Group which at the time of payment of the Lump Sum Payment is a Non-Eligible Investor Group, will be paid a portion of the Lump Sum Payment equal to the amount of the Lump Sum Payment
multiplied by a quotient where the numerator is the Value of shares held at the time of such payment by the Investor Group affiliated with such Sponsor, and the denominator is the Value of all shares held by all Investor Groups that at such time are
