                          Secured Convertible Debenture


                                Due April 7, 2006

      This Secured  Convertible  Debenture (the "Debenture") is issued by INNOVA
HOLDINGS,  INC, a  Delaware  corporation  (the  "Obligor"),  to CORNELL  CAPITAL
PARTNERS,  LP (the  "Holder"),  pursuant  to that  certain  Securities  Purchase
Agreement (the "Securities Purchase Agreement") of even date herewith.

      FOR VALUE  RECEIVED,  the Obligor hereby  promises to pay to the Holder or
its  successors  and assigns the  principal  sum of Fifty Five  Thousand  (U.S.)
Dollars  ($55,000)  together with accrued but unpaid interest on or before April
7, 2006 (the "Maturity Date") in accordance with the following terms:

      Principal and Interest.  The Obligor hereby  promises to pay the Holder on
the  Maturity  Date in  lawful  money of the  United  States of  America  and in
immediately  available  funds the sum of Fifty Five Thousand  Dollars  ($55,000)
plus  accrued  and unpaid  interest  subject to any  payments  made as set forth
below.  Interest shall accrue on the outstanding  principal balance hereof at an
annual rate equal to twelve percent  (12%).  Interest shall be calculated on the
basis of a 360-day  year and the actual  number of days  elapsed,  to the extent
permitted by applicable  law.  Interest  hereunder will be paid to the Holder or
its  assignee  (as  defined  in  Section  4) in whose  name  this  Debenture  is
registered on the records of the Obligor regarding registration and transfers of
Debentures (the "Debenture Register").

      Payments.  Prior to the Maturity  Date,  the Obligor shall pay directly to
the Holder all revenues  received by the Obligor  until all amounts of principal
and interest  outstanding under this Debenture have been paid. All such payments
shall be due within  five  business  days of receipt by the Obligor and shall be
applied to principal,  accrued  interest and charges and expenses owing under or
in connection  with this  Debenture in such order as the Holder  elects,  except
that  payments  shall  be  applied  to  accrued   interest   before   principal.
Notwithstanding  the foregoing,  this Debenture shall become due and immediately
payable, including all accrued but unpaid interest, upon an Event of Default (as
defined  in  Section 2  hereof).  So long as this  Debenture  is held by Cornell
Capital Partners, LP or its affiliates (as defined in Rule 144 promulgated under
the  Securities  Act,  as  amended),  the  Obligor  may not repay or redeem this
Debenture with the proceeds of the Standby Equity Distribution Agreement between
the Company and Cornell Capital Partners, LP.

      Right of Redemption.  The Obligor at its option shall have the right, with
three (3) business days advance  written notice (the  "Redemption  Notice"),  to
redeem a portion or all amounts  outstanding  under this Debenture  prior to the
Maturity Date in an amount equal to the principal amount outstanding and accrued
interest  (collectively  referred to as the  "Redemption  Amount").  The Obligor
shall deliver to the Holder the  Redemption  Amount on the third (3rd)  business
day after the Redemption Notice.

      Notwithstanding the foregoing in the event that the Obligor has elected to
redeem a portion of the outstanding  principal amount and accrued interest under
this  Debenture the Holder shall still be entitled to effectuate  Conversions as
contemplated hereunder.

(the  "Security  Agreement")  of even date herewith  between the Obligor and the
Holder.

Except  for the  capital  stock to be  issued  pursuant  to the  Standby  Equity
Distribution  Agreement  of even date  herewith  between the Obligor and Cornell
Capital Partners, LP, so long as any of the principal amount or interest on this
Debenture  remains unpaid and  unconverted,  the Obligor shall not,  without the
prior  written  consent of the  Holder,  (i) issue or sell any  common  stock or
preferred stock with or without consideration,  (ii) issue or sell any preferred
stock, warrant,  option, right, contract,  call, or other security or instrument
granting  the holder  thereof the right to acquire  common stock with or without
consideration,  (iii) enter into any security  instrument  granting the holder a
security  interest  in any of the  assets  of the  Obligor,  or  (iv)  file  any
registration statements on Form S-8.

      Section 1. This Debenture is exchangeable for an equal aggregate principal
amount of Debentures of different authorized denominations,  as requested by the
Holder  surrendering  the  same.  No  service  charge  will  be  made  for  such

<PAGE>

            (vi) The Obligor or any  subsidiary  of the Obligor shall be a party
to any Change of Control Transaction (as defined in Section 4);

any Event of Default has occurred,  the full principal amount of this Debenture,
together with interest and other amounts owing in respect  thereof,  to the date
of  acceleration  shall become at the  Holder's  election,  immediately  due and
payable in cash,  provided  however,  the Holder may request  (but shall have no
obligation  to request)  payment of such amounts in Common Stock of the Obligor.
If an Event of Default occurs and remains uncured, the Conversion Price shall be
reduced to $0.005. In addition to any other remedies,  the Holder shall have the

presentment,  demand,  protest or other  notice of any kind,  and the Holder may
immediately  and without  expiration of any grace period  enforce any and all of
its rights and remedies  hereunder and all other remedies  available to it under
applicable law. Such  declaration may be rescinded and annulled by Holder at any
time prior to payment  hereunder.  No such  rescission or annulment shall affect
any subsequent Event of Default or impair any right consequent thereon.  Upon an
Event of Default,  notwithstanding  any other provision of this Debenture or any
Transaction  Document,  the Holder  shall have no  obligation  to comply with or
adhere to any  limitations,  if any, on the  conversion of this Debenture or the
sale of the Underlying Shares.

      Section 3. Conversion.

      (a) (i) Conversion at Option of Holder.


                                       4
<PAGE>

            (A) This Debenture shall be convertible  into shares of Common Stock
at the  option of the  Holder,  in whole or in part at any time and from time to
time,  after the  Original  Issue Date (as defined in Section 4) (subject to the
limitations on conversion set forth in Section 3(a)(ii)  hereof).  The number of
shares of Common Stock issuable upon a conversion  hereunder equals the quotient
obtained  by  dividing  (x)  the  outstanding  amount  of this  Debenture  to be
converted  by (y) the  Conversion  Price (as  defined in Section  3(c)(i)).  The
Obligor shall deliver Common Stock certificates to the Holder prior to the Fifth
(5th) Trading Day after a Conversion Date.

            (B) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, if on
any  Conversion  Date:  (1) the  number of  shares  of Common  Stock at the time
authorized, unissued and unreserved for all purposes, or held as treasury stock,
is  insufficient  to pay  principal  and interest  hereunder in shares of Common
Stock; (2) the Common Stock is not listed or quoted for trading on the OTC or on
a  Subsequent  Market;  (3)  the  Obligor  has  failed  to  timely  satisfy  its
conversion; or (4) the issuance of such shares of Common Stock would result in a
violation of Section 3(a)(ii),  then, at the option of the Holder,  the Obligor,
in lieu of  delivering  shares of Common Stock  pursuant to Section  3(a)(i)(A),
shall deliver, within three (3) Trading Days of each applicable Conversion Date,
an amount in cash equal to the product of the outstanding principal amount to be
converted  plus any interest  due therein  divided by the  Conversion  Price and
multiplied by the highest closing price of the stock from date of the conversion
notice till the date that such cash payment is made.

      Further,  if the Obligor shall not have  delivered any cash due in respect
of conversion of this  Debenture or as payment of interest  thereon by the fifth
(5th) Trading Day after the  Conversion  Date,  the Holder may, by notice to the
Obligor, require the Obligor to issue shares of Common Stock pursuant to Section
3(c), except that for such purpose the Conversion Price applicable thereto shall
be the lesser of the Conversion  Price on the Conversion Date and the Conversion
Price on the date of such Holder demand.  Any such shares will be subject to the
provisions of this Section.

            (C) The Holder shall effect conversions by delivering to the Obligor
a  completed  notice in the form  attached  hereto as  Exhibit A (a  "Conversion
Notice").  The date on which a Conversion Notice is delivered is the "Conversion
Date." Unless the Holder is converting the entire principal  amount  outstanding
under this  Debenture,  the Holder is not required to physically  surrender this
Debenture to the Obligor in order to effect conversions.  Conversions  hereunder
shall have the  effect of  lowering  the  outstanding  principal  amount of this
Debenture plus all accrued and unpaid interest thereon in an amount equal to the
applicable conversion. The Holder and the Obligor shall maintain records showing
the principal amount converted and the date of such conversions. In the event of
any dispute or  discrepancy,  the records of the Holder shall be controlling and
determinative in the absence of manifest error.

            (ii) Certain Conversion Restrictions.


                                       5
<PAGE>

                  (A) A Holder may not convert this  Debenture or receive shares
of Common Stock as payment of interest  hereunder to the extent such  conversion
or receipt of such interest  payment  would result in the Holder,  together with
any affiliate  thereof,  beneficially  owning (as determined in accordance  with
Section  13(d) of the  Exchange  Act and the rules  promulgated  thereunder)  in
excess of 4.9% of the then  issued  and  outstanding  shares  of  Common  Stock,
including  shares  issuable upon conversion of, and payment of interest on, this
Debenture  held by such Holder  after  application  of this  Section.  Since the
Holder  will not be  obligated  to report to the Obligor the number of shares of
Common  Stock it may  hold at the time of a  conversion  hereunder,  unless  the
conversion  at issue would  result in the  issuance of shares of Common Stock in
excess of 4.9% of the then outstanding  shares of Common Stock without regard to
any other shares which may be  beneficially  owned by the Holder or an affiliate
thereof, the Holder shall have the authority and obligation to determine whether
the restriction  contained in this Section will limit any particular  conversion
hereunder  and to the extent  that the  Holder  determines  that the  limitation
contained in this Section  applies,  the  determination  of which portion of the
principal  amount of this Debenture is convertible  shall be the  responsibility
and  obligation of the Holder.  If the Holder has delivered a Conversion  Notice
for a  principal  amount of this  Debenture  that,  without  regard to any other
shares that the Holder or its affiliates may  beneficially  own, would result in
the issuance in excess of the  permitted  amount  hereunder,  the Obligor  shall
notify the Holder of this fact and shall  honor the  conversion  for the maximum
principal amount permitted to be converted on such Conversion Date in accordance
with the  periods  described  in Section  3(a)(i)(A)  and,  at the option of the
Holder,  either retain any principal amount tendered for conversion in excess of
the  permitted  amount  hereunder for future  conversions  or return such excess
principal amount to the Holder.  The provisions of this Section may be waived by
a Holder (but only as to itself and not to any other  Holder) upon not less than
65 days prior notice to the Obligor.  Other  Holders  shall be unaffected by any
such waiver.

      (b) (i)  Nothing  herein  shall  limit a Holder's  right to pursue  actual
damages  or declare  an Event of  Default  pursuant  to Section 2 herein for the
Obligor 's failure to deliver  certificates  representing shares of Common Stock
upon conversion  within the period  specified  herein and such Holder shall have
the right to pursue all remedies  available to it at law or in equity including,
without limitation,  a decree of specific  performance and/or injunctive relief,
in each case  without  the need to post a bond or provide  other  security.  The
exercise  of any such  rights  shall not  prohibit  the Holder  from  seeking to
enforce damages pursuant to any other Section hereof or under applicable law.

            (ii) In addition to any other rights available to the Holder, if the
Obligor fails to deliver to the Holder such certificate or certificates pursuant
to Section  3(a)(i)(A) by the fifth (5th) Trading Day after the Conversion Date,
and if after such fifth  (5th)  Trading  Day the  Holder  purchases  (in an open
market  transaction or otherwise)  Common Stock to deliver in  satisfaction of a
sale by such  Holder  of the  Underlying  Shares  which the  Holder  anticipated
receiving upon such  conversion (a "Buy-In"),  then the Obligor shall (A) pay in
cash to the Holder (in addition to any  remedies  available to or elected by the
Holder) the amount by which (x) the Holder's  total  purchase  price  (including
brokerage commissions, if any) for the Common Stock so purchased exceeds (y) the
product of (1) the  aggregate  number of shares of Common Stock that such Holder
anticipated  receiving from the conversion at issue multiplied by (2) the market
price of the Common  Stock at the time of the sale giving rise to such  purchase
obligation  and (B) at the option of the Holder,  either  reissue a Debenture in
the principal amount equal to the principal  amount of the attempted  conversion
or deliver  to the  Holder the number of shares of Common  Stock that would have
been issued had the Obligor timely complied with its delivery requirements under
Section  3(a)(i)(A).  For example, if the Holder purchases Common Stock having a
total  purchase  price of $11,000 to cover a Buy-In with respect to an attempted
conversion  of  Debentures  with  respect  to  which  the  market  price  of the
Underlying  Shares on the date of conversion was a total of $10,000 under clause
(A) of the immediately preceding sentence,  the Obligor shall be required to pay
the  Holder  $1,000.  The  Holder  shall  provide  the  Obligor  written  notice
indicating the amounts payable to the Holder in respect of the Buy-In.


                                       6

      (c) (i) The  conversion  price (the  "Conversion  Price") in effect on any
Conversion  Date shall be equal to Three  Cents  ($0.03),  which may be adjusted
pursuant to the other terms of this Debenture.

            (ii)  If  the  Obligor,   at  any  time  while  this   Debenture  is
outstanding,  shall (a) pay a stock dividend or otherwise make a distribution or
distributions  on  shares  of its  Common  Stock or any  other  equity or equity
equivalent   securities  payable  in  shares  of  Common  Stock,  (b)  subdivide
outstanding  shares of Common Stock into a larger number of shares,  (c) combine
(including  by way of reverse  stock split)  outstanding  shares of Common Stock
into a smaller number of shares, or (d) issue by  reclassification  of shares of
the Common Stock any shares of capital stock of the Obligor, then the Conversion
Price  shall be  multiplied  by a fraction of which the  numerator  shall be the
number of shares of Common Stock (excluding treasury shares, if any) outstanding
before such event and of which the denominator  shall be the number of shares of
Common Stock  outstanding after such event. Any adjustment made pursuant to this
Section  shall  become  effective  immediately  after  the  record  date for the
determination of stockholders  entitled to receive such dividend or distribution
and shall become effective immediately after the effective date in the case of a
subdivision, combination or re-classification.

            (iii)  If  the  Obligor,   at  any  time  while  this  Debenture  is
outstanding,  shall issue  rights,  options or warrants to all holders of Common
Stock (and not to the Holder) entitling them to subscribe for or purchase shares
of  Common  Stock at a price per share  less than the  Closing  Bid Price at the
record date mentioned below,  then the Conversion Price shall be multiplied by a
fraction,  of which the denominator  shall be the number of shares of the Common
Stock (excluding treasury shares, if any) outstanding on the date of issuance of
such rights or warrants  (plus the number of  additional  shares of Common Stock
offered for  subscription or purchase),  and of which the numerator shall be the
number  of  shares of the  Common  Stock  (excluding  treasury  shares,  if any)
outstanding on the date of issuance of such rights or warrants,  plus the number
of shares which the  aggregate  offering  price of the total number of shares so
offered would purchase at such Closing Bid Price.  Such adjustment shall be made
whenever  such  rights  or  warrants  are  issued,  and shall  become  effective
immediately after the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled
to receive such rights, options or warrants. However, upon the expiration of any
such  right,  option or  warrant  to  purchase  shares of the  Common  Stock the
issuance of which resulted in an adjustment in the Conversion  Price pursuant to
this  Section,  if any such right,  option or warrant shall expire and shall not
have been exercised, the Conversion Price shall immediately upon such expiration
be recomputed and effective immediately upon such expiration be increased to the
price  which it would have been (but  reflecting  any other  adjustments  in the
Conversion  Price made  pursuant to the  provisions  of this  Section  after the
issuance of such rights or warrants) had the adjustment of the Conversion  Price
made upon the  issuance of such  rights,  options or  warrants  been made on the
basis of offering for subscription or purchase only that number of shares of the
Common Stock  actually  purchased  upon the exercise of such rights,  options or
warrants actually exercised.


                                       7
<PAGE>

            (iv) If the Obligor or any subsidiary thereof, as applicable, at any
time while this Debenture is outstanding,  shall issue shares of Common Stock or
rights, warrants,  options or other securities or debt that are convertible into
or  exchangeable  for  shares  of  Common  Stock  ("Common  Stock  Equivalents")
entitling  any Person to acquire  shares of Common  Stock,  at a price per share
less than the  Conversion  Price (if the  holder of the  Common  Stock or Common
Stock  Equivalent so issued shall at any time,  whether by operation of purchase
price adjustments, reset provisions,  floating conversion,  exercise or exchange
prices or  otherwise,  or due to warrants,  options or rights per share which is
issued in connection with such issuance, be entitled to receive shares of Common
Stock at a price  per  share  which  is less  than the  Conversion  Price,  such
issuance shall be deemed to have occurred for less than the  Conversion  Price),
then, at the sole option of the Holder,  the Conversion  Price shall be adjusted
to mirror the  conversion,  exchange or purchase  price for such Common Stock or
Common Stock Equivalents (including any reset provisions thereof) at issue. Such
adjustment shall be made whenever such Common Stock or Common Stock  Equivalents
are issued.  The Obligor  shall notify the Holder in writing,  no later than one
(1)  business  day  following  the  issuance of any Common Stock or Common Stock
Equivalent subject to this Section,  indicating therein the applicable  issuance
price, or of applicable reset price, exchange price,  conversion price and other
pricing  terms.  No  adjustment  under this Section shall be made as a result of
issuances and exercises of options to purchase shares of Common Stock issued for
compensatory  purposes  pursuant to any of the  Obligor's  stock option or stock
purchase plans.

            (v) If the Obligor, at any time while this Debenture is outstanding,
shall  distribute  to all  holders  of  Common  Stock  (and  not to the  Holder)
evidences of its  indebtedness  or assets or rights or warrants to subscribe for
or purchase any security,  then in each such case the Conversion  Price at which
this  Debenture  shall   thereafter  be  convertible   shall  be  determined  by
multiplying the Conversion Price in effect  immediately prior to the record date
fixed for determination of stockholders entitled to receive such distribution by
a fraction of which the denominator shall be the Closing Bid Price determined as
of the record date  mentioned  above,  and of which the numerator  shall be such
Closing Bid Price on such  record  date less the then fair market  value at such
record  date of the  portion  of such  assets or  evidence  of  indebtedness  so
distributed  applicable  to  one  outstanding  share  of  the  Common  Stock  as
determined  by the  Board  of  Directors  in good  faith.  In  either  case  the
adjustments  shall be  described  in a  statement  provided to the Holder of the
portion  of  assets  or  evidences  of   indebtedness  so  distributed  or  such
subscription  rights  applicable to one share of Common Stock.  Such  adjustment

with all accrued but unpaid  interest and any other amounts then owing hereunder
in respect of this Debenture into the shares of stock and other securities, cash
and property receivable upon or deemed to be held by holders of the Common Stock
following  such  reclassification  or share  exchange,  and the  Holder  of this
Debenture  shall  be  entitled  upon  such  event  to  receive  such  amount  of
securities,  cash or property  as the shares of the Common  Stock of the Obligor
into which the then outstanding principal amount,  together with all accrued but
unpaid  interest and any other  amounts then owing  hereunder in respect of this
Debenture could have been converted  immediately prior to such  reclassification
or share exchange would have been entitled, or (B) require the Obligor to prepay
the outstanding principal amount of this Debenture,  plus all interest and other
amounts due and payable  thereon.  The entire  prepayment price shall be paid in
cash. This provision shall  similarly apply to successive  reclassifications  or

            (vii) The Obligor  shall  maintain a share  reserve of not less than
one  hundred  percent  (100%)  of the  shares  of  Common  Stock  issuable  upon
conversion of this  Debenture;  and within three (3) Business Days following the
receipt  by the  Obligor  of a  Holder's  notice  that  such  minimum  number of
Underlying  Shares is not so  reserved,  the Obligor  shall  promptly  reserve a
sufficient number of shares of Common Stock to comply with such requirement.

            (viii) All calculations  under this Section 3 shall be rounded up to
the nearest $0.001 of a share.

            (ix) Whenever the Conversion Price is adjusted pursuant to Section 3
hereof, the Obligor shall promptly mail to the Holder a notice setting forth the
Conversion  Price after such  adjustment and setting forth a brief  statement of
the facts requiring such adjustment.

            (x) If (A) the  Obligor  shall  declare  a  dividend  (or any  other
distribution)  on the Common  Stock;  (B) the  Obligor  shall  declare a special
nonrecurring  cash  dividend on or a  redemption  of the Common  Stock;  (C) the
Obligor  shall  authorize the granting to all holders of the Common Stock rights
or warrants to  subscribe  for or  purchase  any shares of capital  stock of any

shall be required in connection with any  reclassification  of the Common Stock,
any  consolidation  or  merger  to which  the  Obligor  is a party,  any sale or
transfer  of all or  substantially  all of the  assets  of the  Obligor,  of any
compulsory  share  exchange  whereby the Common  Stock is  converted  into other
securities,  cash or property;  or (E) the Obligor shall authorize the voluntary
or  involuntary  dissolution,  liquidation  or winding up of the  affairs of the
Obligor;  then, in each case, the Obligor shall cause to be filed at each office
or agency maintained for the purpose of conversion of this Debenture,  and shall
cause to be mailed to the Holder at its last address as it shall appear upon the
stock books of the  Obligor,  at least  twenty (20)  calendar  days prior to the
applicable record or effective date hereinafter  specified, a notice stating (x)
the date on which a record  is to be taken  for the  purpose  of such  dividend,
distribution, redemption, rights or warrants, or if a record is not to be taken,
the date as of which the holders of the Common Stock of record to be entitled to
such  dividend,  distributions,   redemption,  rights  or  warrants  are  to  be
determined  or (y)  the  date on  which  such  reclassification,  consolidation,
merger,  sale,  transfer or share  exchange is expected to become  effective  or
close,  and the date as of which it is expected that holders of the Common Stock
of record  shall be entitled to exchange  their  shares of the Common  Stock for
securities,  cash or other  property  deliverable  upon  such  reclassification,
consolidation,  merger,  sale,  transfer or share exchange,  provided,  that the
failure to mail such  notice or any defect  therein  or in the  mailing  thereof
shall not affect the validity of the corporate  action  required to be specified
in such  notice.  The Holder is entitled to convert  this  Debenture  during the
20-day calendar period  commencing the date of such notice to the effective date
of the event triggering such notice.


                                       9

            (xi) In case of any (1) merger or  consolidation  of the  Obligor or
any  subsidiary of the Obligor with or into another  Person,  or (2) sale by the
Obligor or any  subsidiary of the Obligor of more than one-half of the assets of
the Obligor in one or a series of related transactions,  a Holder shall have the
right to (A) exercise any rights under Section  2(b),  (B) convert the aggregate
amount of this  Debenture  then  outstanding  into the shares of stock and other
securities, cash and property receivable upon or deemed to be held by holders of
Common Stock following such merger, consolidation or sale, and such Holder shall
be entitled  upon such event or series of related  events to receive such amount
of  securities,  cash and property as the shares of Common Stock into which such
aggregate   principal  amount  of  this  Debenture  could  have  been  converted
immediately  prior to such  merger,  consolidation  or  sales  would  have  been
entitled, or (C) in the case of a merger or consolidation, require the surviving
entity to issue to the Holder a convertible  Debenture  with a principal  amount
equal to the  aggregate  principal  amount of this  Debenture  then held by such
Holder,  plus all accrued and unpaid  interest and other amounts owing  thereon,
which such  newly  issued  convertible  Debenture  shall  have  terms  identical
(including with respect to conversion) to the terms of this Debenture, and shall
be entitled to all of the rights and  privileges of the Holder of this Debenture
set forth  herein and the  agreements  pursuant  to which this  Debentures  were
issued. In the case of clause (C), the conversion price applicable for the newly
issued shares of convertible preferred stock or convertible  Debentures shall be
based upon the amount of securities, cash and property that each share of Common
Stock  would  receive in such  transaction  and the  Conversion  Price in effect
immediately prior to the effectiveness or closing date for such transaction. The
terms of any such merger,  sale or consolidation  shall include such terms so as
to  continue to give the Holder the right to receive  the  securities,  cash and
property set forth in this Section upon any  conversion or redemption  following
such event. This provision shall similarly apply to successive such events.

      (d) The  Obligor  covenants  that it will at all  times  reserve  and keep
available out of its authorized  and unissued  shares of Common Stock solely for
the  purpose of  issuance  upon  conversion  of this  Debenture  and  payment of
interest on this Debenture, each as herein provided, free from preemptive rights
or any other actual contingent purchase rights of persons other than the Holder,
not less than such number of shares of the Common Stock as shall (subject to any
additional  requirements  of the  Obligor as to  reservation  of such shares set
forth in this  Debenture) be issuable  (taking into account the  adjustments and
restrictions  of Sections 2(b) and 3(c)) upon the conversion of the  outstanding
principal  amount of this  Debenture  and  payment of  interest  hereunder.  The
Obligor  covenants  that all shares of Common  Stock  that shall be so  issuable
shall,  upon  issue,  be duly and  validly  authorized,  issued and fully  paid,
nonassessable  and, if the  Underlying  Shares  Registration  Statement has been
declared  effective  under the  Securities  Act,  registered  for public sale in
accordance with such Underlying Shares Registration Statement.

      (e) Upon a conversion hereunder the Obligor shall not be required to issue
stock certificates representing fractions of shares of the Common Stock, but may
if otherwise permitted,  make a cash payment in respect of any final fraction of
a share based on the Closing Bid Price at such time. If the Obligor  elects not,
or is unable,  to make such a cash  payment,  the Holder  shall be  entitled  to
receive,  in lieu of the final  fraction  of a share,  one whole share of Common
Stock.


                                       10

      (f) The  issuance  of  certificates  for  shares  of the  Common  Stock on
conversion of this Debenture  shall be made without charge to the Holder thereof
for any documentary stamp or similar taxes that may be payable in respect of the
issue or delivery of such  certificate,  provided  that the Obligor shall not be
required to pay any tax that may be payable in respect of any transfer  involved
in the issuance and delivery of any such  certificate  upon conversion in a name
other than that of the Holder of such  Debenture  so  converted  and the Obligor
shall not be required to issue or deliver such certificates  unless or until the
person or persons requesting the issuance thereof shall have paid to the Obligor
the  amount of such tax or shall have  established  to the  satisfaction  of the
Obligor that such tax has been paid.

      (g) Any notices,  consents,  waivers or other  communications  required or
permitted  to be given  under the terms  hereof  must be in writing  and will be
deemed to have been delivered: (i) upon receipt, when delivered personally; (ii)
upon receipt,  when sent by facsimile (provided  confirmation of transmission is
mechanically or electronically generated and kept on file by the sending party);
or  (iii)  one (1)  trading  day  after  deposit  with a  nationally  recognized

breach  of such  provision  or of any  breach  of any  other  provision  of this
Debenture. The failure of the Holder to insist upon strict adherence to any term
of this Debenture on one or more  occasions  shall not be considered a waiver or

the benefit or advantage of, any stay, extension or usury law or other law which
would  prohibit  or forgive  the  Obligor  from paying all or any portion of the
principal of or interest on this  Debenture  as  contemplated  herein,  wherever
enacted,  now or at any time  hereafter  in  force,  or  which  may  affect  the
covenants or the performance of this  indenture,  and the Obligor (to the extent
it may lawfully do so) hereby  expressly waives all benefits or advantage of any
such law,  and  covenants  that it will not, by resort to any such law,  hinder,
delay or impeded the  execution of any power herein  granted to the Holder,  but
will  suffer and permit  the  execution  of every such as though no such law has
been enacted.

due on a day other than a Business  Day,  such payment shall be made on the next
succeeding Business Day.

      Section 14. THE PARTIES HEREBY  KNOWINGLY,  VOLUNTARILY AND  INTENTIONALLY
WAIVE  THE  RIGHT  ANY OF THEM  MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL  BY JURY IN  RESPECT  OF ANY

DEALING,  STATEMENTS  (WHETHER VERBAL OR WRITTEN) OR ACTIONS OF ANY PARTY.  THIS
PROVISION  IS  A  MATERIAL  INDUCEMENT  FOR  THE  PARTIES'  ACCEPTANCE  OF  THIS
AGREEMENT.
