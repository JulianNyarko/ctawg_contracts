Attention: Mr. Bill Karney and Directors


Due to a family illness and a new career opportunity,  which will demand my full
attention,  along with the need for my family  attention,  I hereby  submit this
notice of resignation as Director of e- FoodSafety.com.

As a result,  this  resignation  leaves  absolutely no tie, either  financially,
operationally,  share  ownership or future  obligations  to the  "Company",  and
relinquishes any and all signing authority from this date forward.

This notice is effective immediately and as dated above.

Sincerely,
