<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">THIS AGREEMENT, made and entered into this 3rd day of April, 2006, by and between CHICAGO
MERCANTILE EXCHANGE Inc. (&#147;<I>Employer</I>&#148;), a Delaware Business Corporation, having its principal place

<P align="center" style="font-size: 12pt"><B>RECITALS:</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">WHEREAS, on November&nbsp;7, 2003, Employer and Employee entered into an agreement (the &#147;<I>Prior
Agreement</I>&#148;) whereby Employer agreed to employ Employee as Chief Executive Officer (&#147;CEO&#148;) and
Employee accepted such employment; and


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">WHEREAS, the Prior Agreement expires on December&nbsp;31, 2006, and Employer has an interest in
ensuring continuity of its leadership; and


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">WHEREAS, Employer wishes to continue the services of Employee in the capacity of Chief
Executive Officer upon the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth and Employee wishes to accept
such employment; and


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">WHEREAS, it is desirable that the Prior Agreement be replaced by this Agreement so that, on
and after the date of this Agreement, this Agreement shall contain the terms and conditions
governing the employment of Employee in the capacity as Chief Executive Officer of Employer;


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises contained herein, the parties mutually
agree as follows:


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">1.&nbsp;<B>Employment. </B>Subject to the terms of the Agreement, Employer hereby agrees to continue to
employ Employee during the Agreement Term as Chief Executive Officer and Employee hereby accepts
such employment. Employee shall report to Employer&#146;s Board of Directors, or any successor to the
Board of Directors (hereinafter, &#147;Board&#148; shall mean the Board of Directors of Employer and/or any
successor thereto). The duties and responsibilities of Employee and his relations with the Board,
its Chairman and its officers shall be consistent with the practice during his term as CEO to date.
Employee&#146;s duties shall include, but not be limited to, the performance of all duties associated
with executive oversight and management of Employer. Employee will provide such business and
professional services in the performance of his duties that are consistent with Employee&#146;s position
as Chief Executive Officer, and as shall reasonably be assigned to him by the Board. Employee
shall devote his full time, ability and attention to the business of Employer during the Agreement
Term. During the Agreement Term, Employee shall continue to hold the vested and unvested 8,200
shares that have been granted to him and will hold any additional shares granted to him until such
time as Employee holds a total of 10,000 vested or unvested shares of the Company&#146;s common stock.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt">Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, nothing in the Agreement shall preclude
Employee from participating in the affairs of any governmental, educational or other charitable
institution, engaging in professional speaking and writing activities, and/or serving as a member
of the board of directors of a publicly held corporation (except for a competitor of Employer),
provided Employee notifies the Board prior to his participating in any such activities and as long
as the Board does not determine that any such activities interfere with or diminish Employee&#146;s
obligations under the Agreement. Employee shall be entitled to retain all fees, royalties and other
compensation derived from such activities, in addition to the compensation and other benefits
payable to him under the Agreement, but shall disclose such fees to Employer.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">2.&nbsp;<B>Agreement Term</B>. Employee shall be employed hereunder for a term commencing on January&nbsp;1,
2006, and expiring on December&nbsp;31, 2009, unless sooner terminated as herein provided (&#147;Agreement
Term&#148;). The Agreement Term may be extended or renewed only by the mutual written agreement of the
parties.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">3.&nbsp;<B>Compensation</B>.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:12%; font-size: 12pt">(a) <B>Annual Base Salary</B>. Effective January&nbsp;1, 2006, and continuing through
December&nbsp;31, 2009, Employer shall pay to Employee a base salary at a rate
not less than $850,000 per year (&#147;<I>Base Salary</I>&#148;), payable in accordance with
Employer&#146;s normal payment schedule. During the Agreement Term, the
Compensation Committee of the Board shall review the Base Salary for
increase at such time as the salaries of senior officers of the company are
reviewed generally, and in any event at least annually.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:12%; font-size: 12pt">(b) <B>Bonuses</B>. Employee shall be eligible to participate in Employer&#146;s Annual
Incentive Plan (the &#147;<I>AIP</I>&#148;) as in existence or as amended from time to time
in accordance with its terms. Employee&#146;s target annual incentive shall be
at least 100% of his Base Salary (&#147;<I>AIP Target</I>&#148;) and a maximum annual
incentive of not more than 150% of his Base Salary. Any amendment of the
AIP shall not diminish Employee&#146;s target incentives relative to the target
incentives of the other members of the management team.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:12%; font-size: 12pt">(c) <B>Equity Compensation</B>. Employee shall be eligible to participate in
Employer&#146;s Equity Incentive Plan (&#147;<I>EIP</I>&#148;), as in existence or as amended from
time to time, in accordance with the terms of the Plan for executives in the
Office of the CEO, with a target grant of not less than 300% of his Base
Salary (&#147;<I>EIP Target</I>&#148;). The grant shall be satisfied in the following
manner: (i)&nbsp;15% of the EIP Target amount in the form of restricted stock;
and (ii)&nbsp;85% of the EIP Target amount in the form of non-qualified stock
options. Any amendment of the EIP shall not diminish Employee&#146;s target
grant relative to the target grants of the other executives in the Office of
the CEO.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:12%; font-size: 12pt">(d)&nbsp;If a &#147;<I>Change of Control</I>&#148; (as defined in Employer&#146;s Amended and Restated
Omnibus Stock Plan (&#147;<I>Plan</I>&#148;)) occurs prior to the Employee&#146;s termination of
employment with Employer, all options and shares previously granted to
Employee, which have not fully vested, whether pursuant to this Agreement,
the Prior Agreement or otherwise, will have vesting accelerated so as to
fully vest one year from the date of a Change in Control provided that
Employee does not materially violate any provision of the Agreement in which
case Employee shall not be entitled to any options or shares which had not
fully vested prior to a Change in Control. Employee may exercise all other
vested options in accordance with the terms of the Plan. Thereafter, the
options will continue to be subject to the terms, definitions and provisions
of the Plan and any related option agreement. If Employee is involuntarily
terminated without Cause or resigns with Good Reason within sixty (60)&nbsp;days
prior to a Change of Control or anytime within the one year after a Change
of Control, all unvested options and shares held by the Employee on the date
of Change of Control which would have been granted to Employee had the
Employee been employed on the date of Change of Control shall become granted
and 100% vested.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">4.&nbsp;<B>Benefits</B>. Employee shall be entitled to insurance, vacation and other employee benefits and
perquisites commensurate with his position in accordance with Employer&#146;s policies for executives in
effect from time to time. Without limiting the generality of the immediately preceding sentence,
for each year during the Term of this Agreement, Employee shall be entitled to the following fully
vested benefit accruals (or cash equivalents if said plans are terminated): (a)&nbsp;an annual accrual
under the Chicago Mercantile Exchange Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan equal to three percent
of his annual base pay and accrued AIP payment, and (b) &#147;make-whole&#148; accruals under Employer&#146;s
Senior Management Supplemental Deferred Savings Plan equal to the amount of 401(k) Savings Plan
Discretionary Contribution or CME Pension Plan contributions that would have been accrued under
such plans but for the Internal Revenue Code limitation on compensation that can be considered
under a qualified retirement plan. Employee acknowledges receipt of a summary of Employer&#146;s
employee benefits policies in effect as of the date of this Agreement


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">5.&nbsp;<B>Expense Reimbursement</B>. During the Agreement Term, Employer shall reimburse Employee, in
accordance with Employer&#146;s policies and procedures, for all proper expenses incurred by him in the
performance of his duties hereunder.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">6.&nbsp;<B>Termination</B>.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:12%; font-size: 12pt">(a) <B>Death</B>. Upon the death of Employee, this Agreement shall automatically
terminate and all rights of Employee and his heirs, executors and
administrators to compensation and other benefits under this Agreement shall
cease, except for compensation which shall have accrued to the date of
death, including accrued Base Salary and a prorated AIP Target payment for
the year of termination, and other employee benefits to which Employee is
entitled upon his death, in accordance with the terms of the plans and
programs of Employer including without limitation any accrued, but unpaid,
AIP or EIP payments attributable to completed fiscal years.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:12%; font-size: 12pt">(b) <B>Disability</B>. Employer may, at its option, terminate this Agreement upon
written notice to Employee if Employee, because of physical or mental
incapacity or disability, fails to perform the essential functions of his
position required of him hereunder for a continuous period of 90&nbsp;days or any
120&nbsp;days within any 12-month period. Upon such termination, all obligations
of Employer hereunder shall cease, except for payment of accrued Base Salary
and a prorated AIP Target payment for the year of termination, and other
employee benefits to which Employee is entitled upon his termination
hereunder, in accordance with the terms of the plans and programs of
Employer, including without limitation any accrued, but unpaid, AIP or EIP
payments attributable to completed fiscal years. In the event of any
dispute regarding the existence of Employee&#146;s disability hereunder, the
matter shall be resolved as follows: (1)&nbsp;by the determination of a physician
selected by the Board; (2)&nbsp;Employee shall have the right to challenge that
determination by presenting a contrary determination from a physician of his
choice; (3)&nbsp;in such event, a physician selected by agreement of the Employee
and the Board will make the final determination. The Employee shall submit
to appropriate medical examinations for purposes of making the medical
determinations hereunder.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:12%; font-size: 12pt">(c) <B>Cause</B>. Employer may, at its option, terminate Employee&#146;s employment
under this Agreement for Cause. As used in this Agreement, the term &#147;Cause&#148;

current and potential customer and business relationships, and business strategies and plans
requires substantial time and expense. Such efforts generate for Employer valuable and proprietary
information (&#147;Confidential Information&#148;) which gives Employer a business advantage over others who
do not have such information. Confidential information includes, but is not limited to the
following: trade secrets, technical, business, proprietary or financial information of Employer not
generally known to the public, business plans, proposals, past and current prospect and customer
lists, trading methodologies, systems and programs, training materials, research data bases and

or for his own benefit and that of any person or entity other than Employer,
any Confidential Information. This subsection shall not apply to the extent
Employee remains employed by Employer and is required to disclose
Confidential Information to any regulatory agency or as otherwise required
by law. This subsection shall not apply following termination for any reason
to the extent Employee is required by law to testify in a legislative,
judicial or regulatory proceeding, or is otherwise required by law to
disclose Confidential Information; provided, however, that following
termination for any reason, Employee will promptly notify Employer if
Employee is requested by any entity or person to divulge Confidential
information, and will use his best efforts to ensure that Employer has
sufficient time to intervene and/or object to such disclosure or otherwise
act to protect its interests. Employee shall not disclose any Confidential
Information while any such objection is pending.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:12%; font-size: 12pt">(b)&nbsp;Employee agrees that while employed and for a period of one (1)&nbsp;year

the Employee will not accept employment with or act or provide services as
an independent contractor or consultant for or on behalf of any derivatives
exchange or for any person, organization or entity providing clearing
services. Employee acknowledges that such restriction is necessary to
protect the Confidential Information he learned through his employment with
Employer.

period, scope or area and that the court shall be allowed to revise the
restrictions contained herein to cover the maximum period, scope and area
permitted by law.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">8.&nbsp;<B>Non-solicitation</B>.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:12%; font-size: 12pt">(a) <B>General</B>. Employee acknowledges that Employer invests in recruiting and
training, and shares Confidential Information with, it its employees. As a
result, Employee acknowledges that Employer&#146;s employees are of special,
unique and extraordinary value to Employer.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:12%; font-size: 12pt">(b) <B>Non-solicitation</B>. Employee further agrees that for a period of one (1)

to induce any employee of Employer to terminate or abandon his or her
employment with Employer for any purpose whatsoever.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:12%; font-size: 12pt">(c) <B>Reformation</B>. If a court holds that the restrictions stated in this
Section&nbsp;8 are unreasonable, the parties hereto agree that the maximum
period, scope or geographical area reasonable under the circumstances shall
be substituted for the stated period, scope or area and that the court shall
be allowed to revise the restrictions contained herein to cover the maximum

<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">9.&nbsp;<B>Intellectual Property</B>. During the Agreement Term, Employee shall disclose to Employer and

interest in and to all discoveries and improvements, patentable or otherwise, trade secrets and

acquired by him during his employment with Employer, which may pertain directly or indirectly to
the business of the Employer. Employee shall at any time during or after the Agreement Term, upon

respect to intellectual property developed or which was being developed during Employee&#146;s
employment with Employer.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">10.&nbsp;<B>Remedies</B>. Employee agrees that given the nature of Employer&#146;s business, the scope and
duration of the restrictions in Sections&nbsp;7, 8 and 9 are reasonable and necessary to protect the
legitimate business interests of Employer and do not unduly interfere with Employee&#146;s career or
economic pursuits. Employee recognizes and agrees that a breach of any or all of the provisions of
Sections&nbsp;7, 8 and 9 will constitute immediate and irreparable harm to Employer&#146;s business, for
which damages cannot be readily calculated and for which damages is an inadequate remedy.
Accordingly, Employee acknowledges that Employer shall therefore be entitled to seek an injunction
or injunctions to prevent any breach or threatened breach of any such Section. Employee agrees to
reimburse Employer for all costs and expenses, including reasonable attorney&#146;s fees and costs,
incurred by Employer in connection with the enforcement of its rights under Sections&nbsp;7, 8 and 9 of
this Agreement.

Employer, including any claims that arise after Employee&#146;s termination of employment for any
reason. Employer will purchase Directors and Officer&#146;s insurance coverage that will continue in
effect both during the Agreement Term and, while potential liability exists, thereafter.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">12.&nbsp;<B>Survival</B>. Sections&nbsp;7, 8, 9, 10 and 11 of this Agreement shall survive and continue in full
force and effect in accordance with their respective terms, notwithstanding any termination of the
Agreement.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">13.&nbsp;<B>Arbitration</B>. Except with respect to Sections&nbsp;7, 8, and 9 any dispute or controversy
between Employer and Employee, whether arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the breach of
this Agreement, or otherwise, shall be settled by arbitration in Chicago, Illinois, in accordance
with the following:



<P align="left" style="margin-left:12%; font-size: 12pt">(a)&nbsp;Arbitration hearings will be conducted by the American Arbitration
Association (&#147;<I>AAA</I>&#148;). Except as modified herein, arbitration hearings will be
conducted in accordance with AAA&#146;s employment dispute rules.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:12%; font-size: 12pt">(b)&nbsp;State and federal laws contain statues of limitation which prescribe the
time frames within which parties must file a law suit to have their disputes
resolved through the court system. These same statutes of limitation will
apply in determining the time frame during which the parties must file a
request for arbitration.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:12%; font-size: 12pt">(c)&nbsp;If Employee seeks arbitration, Employee shall submit a filing fee to the
AAA in an amount equal to the lesser of the court filing fee charged in the
state or federal court in Chicago, Illinois. The AAA will bill Employer for
the balance of the filing and arbitrator&#146;s fees.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:12%; font-size: 12pt">(d)&nbsp;The arbitrator shall have the same authority to award (and shall be
limited to awarding) any remedy or relief that a court of competent
jurisdiction could award, including compensatory damages, attorney fees,
punitive damages and reinstatement. Employer and Employee may be represented
by legal counsel or any other individual at their own expense during an
arbitration hearing.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:12%; font-size: 12pt">(e)&nbsp;Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any
court having jurisdiction thereof.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:12%; font-size: 12pt">(f)&nbsp;Except as necessary in court proceedings to enforce this arbitration
provision or an award rendered hereunder, or to obtain interim relief,
neither a party nor an arbitrator may disclose the existence, content or
results of any arbitration hereunder without the prior written consent of
Employer and Employee.
