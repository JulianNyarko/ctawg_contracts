SIZE="2">2.1 <U>Filing a Claim for Benefits </U> </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">To begin the process for obtaining benefits under the Plan, an Eligible Executive must notify the Leave of
Absence Team of his or her disability and request a claim form. This step is called the Initial Notice. An Eligible Executive may appoint an authorized representative to make the Initial Notice and/or to take any other actions on his or her behalf.
</FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">The Eligible Executive must return the completed claim form to the LOA Team within 21 calendar days of the Initial Notice. Failure to return the completed
claim form within this time period will result in a denial of benefits unless the Eligible Executive submits credible evidence that the delay was reasonable due to circumstances beyond his or her control. </FONT></P> <P
STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Benefits may be provided retroactively for a period of leave that occurred up to 30 calendar days prior to the Initial Notice to the LOA Team. Benefits are not available
for portions of leaves that occurred more than 30 days prior to the Initial Notice. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">2.2 <U>The Claim Determination Process </U> </FONT></P> <P
STYLE="margin-top:6px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">The LOA Team reviews the completed claim form and determines whether it contains sufficient information to approve or deny benefits. The LOA Team requires a certification
substantiating the necessity and anticipated duration of the leave from an Authorized Health Care Provider who is treating the Eligible Executive for the condition for which the benefits are requested. The LOA Team may require such additional
medical records and/or a second or third medical opinion from an Authorized Health Care Provider of its choice as it deems appropriate to determine a claim. In reaching a decision, the LOA Team will consider the diagnosis and nature of health care
being received. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">To receive benefits under the Plan, an Eligible Executive must have a non-work related total disability that lasts at least eight full
consecutive days, or a partial disability as explained in Section&nbsp;2.3. For the purposes of this Plan, a total disability is a condition which renders the Eligible Executive unable to perform substantially all of the normal duties of his or her
job. Unless an exception is warranted due to reasonable cause, to qualify for benefits the Eligible Executive must receive treatment for the disabling condition within seven days of the last day worked and receive continuing treatment thereafter for
the condition. In all cases, for benefits to be received, the effect of the care must be of demonstrable medical value for the disabling condition to effectively attain and/or maintain maximum medical improvement. Maximum medical improvement is the
level at which, based on reasonable medical probability, further material recovery from, or lasting improvement to, an injury or sickness can no longer be reasonably anticipated. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT
FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">A complete claim form accompanied by a provider certification and any other necessary medical information will be approved or denied within 45 days of receipt. In the event an incomplete claim is submitted, meaning
that additional information is needed, the LOA Team will notify the Eligible Executive of the additional information or documentation necessary to make a decision. Notice to the Eligible Executive of the need for additional information will suspend
the running of the 45-day decision period. The 45-day decision period will begin running again when the LOA Team receives the additional information. The LOA Team will provide up to two 30-day periods for submission of the necessary information. If
sufficient information is not submitted within that time period for the LOA Team to make a decision on the claim, the claim is treated as denied. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">When a claim for Disability benefits is approved, the Eligible Executive is notified of the duration of the approved
benefit period. When a claim is denied, the Eligible Executive is notified of the reason for the denial, including a description of any additional material or information necessary for the claim to be approved, with an explanation of why such
additional information or material is necessary. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Additionally, if an internal rule, guideline, protocol or other criterion was relied upon in making the
denial decision, that criterion will either be included in the denial notice or the notice will state that such a criterion was relied upon and is available without charge to the Eligible Executive upon request. </FONT></P> <P

Eligible Executives with benefits under the Plan beginning on the eighth consecutive day of an absence due to a Disability. If an Eligible Executive does not remain completely disabled during the seven day waiting period, he or she will not qualify
for benefits under the Plan. During this waiting period, the Eligible Executive will be required to use any available PTO time or other supplemental disability time during the waiting period to the extent consistent with applicable law. </FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">When a claim for Disability benefits is approved, the approval notice will define the period of approved benefits. The benefit period will be determined based on the
certification received from the Authorized Health Care Provider, the nature and expected duration of the disability and other relevant factors. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">If the
Disability continues past the initial period of approved benefits, the Eligible Executive may file a claim for an extension of benefits, together with a certification from an Authorized Health Care Provider in support of the extension. Claims for
extension will be reviewed and determined in accordance with the process set forth in Section&nbsp;2.2 above. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">The maximum duration of benefits under the
Plan is 180 calendar days, inclusive of the seven day waiting period. Partial days are counted as whole days for the purpose of computing the 180 day maximum. If the Eligible Executive continues to be disabled after 180 days and has elected coverage
under WellPoint&#146;s Long Term Disability Plan, he or she may begin to receive benefits under that plan upon exhaustion of Disability benefits and approval of the long term disability claim. </FONT></P> <P
STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Recurrent Disabilities are treated as extensions of the first Disability Absence. Satisfaction of the waiting period for the first period of Disability applies to
Recurrent Disabilities, so benefits may commence without a waiting period. A single 180-day maximum benefit period applies to an initial Disability Absence and all Recurrent Disabilities. The LOA Team determines in its discretion whether a
subsequent condition is the same as or related to the initial condition. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">For a New Period of Disability, a new waiting period will be imposed before
Disability benefits commence, and a new 180-day maximum benefit period will apply. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">2.4 <U>Benefit Levels</U> </FONT></P> <P
STYLE="margin-top:6px;margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:2%; text-indent:-2%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">The benefit for total disability under the Plan consists of 100% of weekly base salary. </FONT></P> <P
STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">To receive benefits for a partial disability, an Eligible Executive must first have a period of total disability which meets the criteria set forth in Section&nbsp;2.2,
including a duration of at least eight consecutive days. This eight-day period cannot be satisfied with days of partial attendance. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Following the period of total disability, the Authorized Health Care Provider who is treating the disabling condition
must provide proof satisfactory to the LOA Team that the Eligible Executive is unable to perform substantially all of the normal duties of his or her job for a portion of the period that comprises his or her normal weekly work schedule. The
Authorized Health Care Provider must submit in writing to the LOA Team the number of hours which the Eligible Executive can work or a weekly reduced set schedule. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"
