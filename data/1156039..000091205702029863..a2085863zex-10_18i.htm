</UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding
anything contained in subsection (iii)&nbsp;or (iv)&nbsp;to the contrary, payment of the lump sum or commencement of installment payments to a Participant whose
Approved Retirement occurred during a Performance Period shall not be made, or commence until after completion of the Performance Period. Also notwithstanding anything contained in this Section to the
contrary, any election to defer payment of the Award Account balance under subsection (iii), (iv)&nbsp;or (v)&nbsp;shall be equal to 90% of the Award Account balance with the other 10% being paid
as soon as practicable after the end of the Performance Period or such earlier date applicable under Section&nbsp;VIII. Each Participant shall make an irrevocable election as to the desired form of
payment of his or her entire Award Account as soon as practicable after the date of the Award in accordance with procedures established by the Committee. If no deferral election is on file and except
as otherwise provided in this Section, awards will be paid in a lump sum as soon as practicable after completion of the Performance Period. If a Participant dies or incurs a Disability before
commencement of payment of the Participant's Award Account, the Award Account shall be determined in accordance with Section&nbsp;VIII, and payment shall be made in a single lump sum as soon as
practicable after completion of the Performance Period; provided, however, that the Participant or, if deceased, the Participant's Beneficiary may petition the Compensation Committee on the basis of
financial hardship to pay the Award Account as soon as practicable after the Participant's death or Disability. The Compensation Committee may grant such a petition if it determines on the basis of
the evidence submitted that such action is necessary to prevent financial hardship to the Participant or his/her heirs. </FONT></P>
