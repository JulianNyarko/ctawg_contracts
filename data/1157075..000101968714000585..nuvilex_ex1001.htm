or merge with or into (whether or not the Company is the surviving corporation) another Person, with the result that the holders
of the Company&rsquo;s capital stock immediately prior to such consolidation or merger together beneficially own less than 50%
of the outstanding voting power of the surviving or resulting corporation, or (B) sell, lease, license, assign, transfer, convey
or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of the properties or assets of the Company to another Person, or (C) take action
to facilitate a purchase, tender or exchange offer by another Person that is accepted by the holders of more than 50% of the outstanding

purchase agreement or other business combination (including, without limitation, a reorganization, recapitalization, spin-off or
scheme of arrangement) with another Person whereby such other Person acquires more than 50% of the outstanding shares of Common
Stock (not including any shares of Common Stock held by the other Person or other Persons making or party to, or associated or
affiliated with the other Persons making or party to, such stock or share purchase agreement or other business combination), or
(2) any &ldquo;person&rdquo; or &ldquo;group&rdquo; (as these terms are used for purposes of Sections 13(d) and 14(d) of the Exchange
Act) is or shall become the &ldquo;beneficial owner&rdquo; (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act), directly or indirectly,
