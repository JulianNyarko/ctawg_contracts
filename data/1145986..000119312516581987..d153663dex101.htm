attached hereto as Exhibit E. The Company&#146;s agreement to locate the Project at the Project Site is based, in part, on the incentives being offered by the Local Government Entities as described herein. Such incentives are being offered to induce
the Company to locate the Project at the Project Site, with attendant job creation and investment on the part of the Company, all of which constitutes valuable, non-cash consideration to the Local Government Entities and the citizens of the City, of
the County and of the State. The Parties acknowledge that the incentives provided for in this Agreement serve a public purpose through the job creation and investment generation represented by the Project. The Parties further acknowledge that the
cost/benefit requirements applicable to the Local Government Entities in the course of providing such incentives dictate that some measure of recovery must be applied in the event that the anticipated jobs and investment do not for any reason fully
materialize. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:24pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="center"><B>ARTICLE VIII </B></P>
