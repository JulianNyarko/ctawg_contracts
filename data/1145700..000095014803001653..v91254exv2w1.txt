the respective parties thereto, are in full force and effect, and Seller is not,
nor, to the knowledge of Seller, has any other party thereto violated any
provision of, or committed or failed to perform any act which with notice, lapse

intention to effect such transfer, sale, assignment or pledge. Each such notice
shall describe the manner and circumstances of the proposed transfer, sale,
assignment or pledge in sufficient detail, and shall be accompanied, at such
holder's expense by either an unqualified written opinion of legal counsel who
shall be, and whose legal opinion shall be, reasonably satisfactory to the
Purchaser addressed to the Purchaser, to the effect that the proposed transfer

entitled to transfer such Purchaser Securities in accordance with the terms of

Board of Directors of the Purchaser. Each certificate evidencing the Purchaser
Securities transferred as above provided shall bear, except if such transfer is
made pursuant to Rule 144, the appropriate restrictive legend set forth in
Section 10.9 above, except that such certificate shall not bear such restrictive
legend if in the opinion of counsel for such holder and the Purchaser such
legend is not required in order to establish compliance with any provision of
the Securities Act
