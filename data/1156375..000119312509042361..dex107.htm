shares of Stock upon the exercise of an Option, or (iii)&nbsp;pursuant to an Award. At the time of such vesting, lapse, or exercise, the Grantee shall pay to the Company or the Affiliate, as the case may be, any amount that the Company or the
Affiliate may reasonably determine to be necessary to satisfy such withholding obligation. Subject to the prior approval of the Company or the Affiliate, which may be withheld by the Company or the Affiliate, as the case may be, in its sole
discretion, the Grantee may elect to satisfy such obligations, in whole or in part, (i)&nbsp;by causing the Company or the Affiliate to withhold the minimum required number of shares of Stock otherwise issuable to the Grantee as may be necessary to
satisfy such withholding obligation or (ii)&nbsp;by delivering to the Company or the Affiliate shares of Stock already owned by the Grantee. The shares of Stock so delivered or withheld shall have an aggregate Fair Market Value equal to such
withholding obligations. The Fair Market Value of the shares of Stock used to satisfy such withholding obligation shall be determined by the Company or the Affiliate as of the date that the amount of tax to be withheld is to be determined. A Grantee
who has made an election pursuant to this <B>Section&nbsp;16.3</B> may satisfy his or her withholding obligation only with shares of Stock that are not subject to any repurchase, forfeiture, unfulfilled vesting, or other similar requirements.
