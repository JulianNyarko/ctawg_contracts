from future Awards under the Plan) any such Employee, Consultant or Director at any time for any reason. The Company shall not be liable for the loss of existing or potential profit from an Award granted in the event of termination of an employment
or other relationship. No Employee or Participant shall have any claim to be granted any Award under the Plan, and there is no obligation for uniformity of treatment of Employees or Participants under the Plan. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">13.3 <U>Prospective Recipient</U>. The prospective recipient of any Award under the Plan shall not, with respect to such Award, be deemed to
have become a Participant, or to have any rights with respect to such Award, until and unless such recipient shall have executed an agreement or other instrument evidencing the Award and delivered a copy thereof to the Company, and otherwise
complied with the then applicable terms and conditions. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">13.4 <U>Cancellation of Award</U>. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, all outstanding Awards granted to any Participant may be canceled in the discretion of the Committee if the Participant&#146;s Continuous Status as an Employee, Director or Consultant is terminated for Cause, or if, after the
termination of the Participant&#146;s Continuous Status as an Employee, Director, or Consultant, the Committee determines that Cause existed before such termination. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">13.5 <U>Stop Transfer Orders</U>. All certificates for Shares delivered under the Plan pursuant to any Award shall be subject to such
stop-transfer orders and other restrictions as the Committee may deem advisable under the provisions of this Plan, the rules, regulations and other requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission, any stock exchange upon which the Shares are
then listed, and any applicable federal or state securities law, and the Committee may cause a legend or legends to be put on any such certificates to make appropriate reference to such restrictions. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">13.6 <U>Nature of Payments</U>. All Awards made pursuant to the Plan are in consideration of services performed or to be performed for the
Company or any Affiliate, division or business unit of the Company. Any income or gain realized pursuant to Awards under the Plan and any Stock Appreciation Rights constitute a special incentive payment to the Participant and shall not be taken into
account, to the extent permissible under Applicable Law, as compensation for purposes of any of the employee benefit plans of the Company or any Affiliate except as may be determined by the Committee or by the Board or board of directors of the
applicable Affiliate. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">13.7 <U>Other Plans</U>. Nothing contained in the Plan shall prevent the Board from adopting other or additional

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">13.8 <U>Severability</U>. If any provision of the Plan shall be held unlawful or otherwise
invalid or unenforceable in whole or in part by a court of competent jurisdiction, such provision shall (a)&nbsp;be deemed limited to the extent that such court of competent jurisdiction deems it lawful, valid and/or enforceable and as so limited
shall remain in full force and effect, and (b)&nbsp;not affect any other provision of the Plan or part thereof, each of which shall remain in full force and effect. If the making of any payment or the provision of any other benefit required under
the Plan shall be held unlawful or otherwise invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, such unlawfulness, invalidity or unenforceability shall not prevent any other payment or benefit from being made or provided under the Plan,
and if the making of any payment in full or the provision of any other benefit required under the Plan in full would be unlawful or otherwise invalid or unenforceable, then such unlawfulness, invalidity or unenforceability shall not prevent such
payment or benefit from being made or provided in part, to the extent that it would not be unlawful, invalid or unenforceable, and the maximum payment or benefit that would not be unlawful, invalid or unenforceable shall be made or provided under
the Plan. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">13.9 <U>Construction</U>. All references in the Plan to &#147;<B>Section,</B>&#148; &#147;<B>Sections,</B>&#148; or

deemed to be terms of limitation, but rather shall be deemed to be followed by the words &#147;<B>without limitation.</B>&#148; </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">13.10
<U>Unfunded Status of the Plan</U>. The Plan is intended to constitute an &#147;<B>unfunded</B>&#148; plan for incentive and deferred compensation. With respect to any payments not yet made to a Participant by the Company, nothing contained herein
shall give any such Participant any rights that are greater than those of a general creditor of the Company. In its sole discretion, the Committee may authorize the creation of trusts or other arrangements to meet the obligations created under the
Plan to deliver the Shares or payments in lieu of or with respect to Awards hereunder; provided, however, that the existence of such trusts or other arrangements is consistent with the unfunded status of the Plan. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">13.11 <U>Governing Law</U>. The Plan and all determinations made and actions taken thereunder, to the extent not otherwise governed by the
Code or the laws of the United States, shall be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware and construed accordingly. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">13.12

Applicable Laws at a duly constituted meeting of the stockholders of the Company. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan to the contrary, if stockholders of the Company do not approve the Plan, the Plan shall be void and null <I>ab
initio</I> and the 2011 Plan shall continue in full force and effect. If the stockholders of the Company do not approve the Plan in the manner set forth herein, all Awards granted under the Plan shall be subject to the terms of the 2011 Plan. If the
Company&#146;s stockholders approve the Plan as set forth above, Awards may be granted under the Plan at any time and from time to time on or prior to the tenth anniversary of the effective date of the Plan (e.g., April&nbsp;19, 2026) (unless the
Board sooner suspends or terminates the Plan under Section&nbsp;12.1), on which date the Plan will expire except as to Awards then outstanding under the Plan (which Awards shall remain in effect until they have been exercised or terminated, or have
expired). Assuming approval by the stockholders of the Plan and notwithstanding the foregoing, unless affirmative votes representing a majority of the votes cast under Applicable Laws approve the continuation of Article 10 at the first duly
constituted meeting of the stockholders of the Company that occurs in the fifth year following the effective date of the Plan, no Awards other than Options or Stock Appreciation Rights, or Restricted Stock that is not intended to satisfy the
requirements of Article 10, shall be made to Covered Employees following the date of such meeting. </P>

or employed outside the United States, or both, on such terms and conditions different from those applicable to Awards to Employees employed in the United States as may, in the judgment of the Committee, be necessary or desirable in order to
recognize differences in local law or tax policy. The Committee also may impose conditions on the exercise or vesting of Awards in order to minimize the Company&#146;s obligation with respect to tax equalization for Employees on assignments outside
their home country. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">13.14 <U>Prior Plans</U>. Upon approval of the Original Plan by the Company&#146;s stockholders on June&nbsp;19,
