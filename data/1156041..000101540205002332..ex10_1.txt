addition to the other representations, warranties and agreements contained in
this Agreement, the Company represents and warrants to, and agrees with, the
Purchaser as follows:

               (a)     The Company has prepared a private placement memorandum
     dated April 20, 2005 (the "Private Placement Memorandum") and setting forth
     information concerning the Company, the Securities, the Transaction
     Documents, the Transactions and certain other matters. A copy of the
     Private Placement Memorandum has been delivered by the Company to the
     Purchaser. As used in this Agreement, "Private Placement Memorandum" means
     the Private Placement Memorandum including the documents incorporated by
     reference therein, as amended or supplemented. The Private Placement
     Memorandum did not as of its date, and will not as of the Closing Date,
     contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material
     fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the
     circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

               The documents incorporated by reference in the Preliminary
     Private Placement Memorandum (the "Incorporated Documents"), when they
     became effective or were filed with the Commission, as the case may be,
     conformed in all material respects to the requirements of the Securities
     Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations of the
     Commission thereunder (collectively, the "Exchange Act"); and none of such
     documents contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to
     state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make
     the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they
     were made, not misleading; and any further documents so filed and
     incorporated by reference in the Private Placement Memorandum will conform
     in all material respects to the requirements of the Exchange Act and will
     not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
     material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
     statements therein, in the light of the circumstances in which they were
     made, not misleading.

               (b)     The Company has been duly incorporated or formed and is
     validly existing and in good standing as a corporation or a limited
     liability company under the laws of its respective jurisdiction of
     incorporation or formation, is duly qualified to do business and is in good
     standing as a foreign corporation or limited liability company in each
     jurisdiction in which its ownership or lease of property or the conduct of
     its businesses requires such qualification, and has all power and authority
     necessary to own, lease or hold its properties and to conduct the
     businesses in which it is engaged. Except as set forth in the Private
     Placement Memorandum, the Company does not own, directly or indirectly, any
     shares of common stock or any other equity or long-term debt securities

     or have any equity interest in any firm, partnership, joint venture or
     other entity. The Company does not have any subsidiaries.

               (c)     The Company has an authorized capitalization as set forth
     in the Private Placement Memorandum, and all of the issued shares of common
     stock of the Company have been duly and validly authorized and issued, are
     fully paid and non-assessable and conform to the description thereof
     contained in the Private Placement Memorandum; and, except for directors'
     qualifying shares, are owned directly or indirectly by the Company, free
     and clear of all liens, encumbrances, equities, claims or adverse interests
     (collectively, "Liens") of any nature. Except as disclosed in the Private
     Placement Memorandum, (i) there are no outstanding securities convertible
     into or exchangeable for, or warrants, options or rights issued by the
     Company to purchase, any shares of the Common Stock, (ii) there are no
     statutory, contractual, preemptive or other rights to subscribe for or to

     of the Common Stock pursuant to the Company's charter or bylaws.

               (d)     Except as set forth in the Private Placement Memorandum
     and except with respect to the rights contained in the Registration Rights
     Agreement, there are no contracts, agreements or other documents between
     the Company and any person granting such person the right to require the
     Company to file a registration statement under the Securities Act with
     respect to any securities of the Company owned or to be owned, directly or
     indirectly, by such person.

               (e)     There has been no change in the authorized capitalization
     of the Company since the date indicated in the Private Placement Memorandum
     except with respect to (i) changes occurring in the ordinary course of
     business and (ii) changes in outstanding common stock resulting from
     transactions relating to an employee benefit plan, qualified stock option
     plans or other employee compensation plans existing on the date hereof.

               (f)     Since the date as of which information is given in the
     Private Placement Memorandum through the date hereof, the Company has not

     paid any dividend on any of its common stock.

               (g)     Except as set forth in the Private Placement Memorandum,
     there are no legal or governmental proceedings pending to which the Company
     is a party or of which any property or assets of any of the Company is
     subject which, if determined adversely to such companies, individually or
     in the aggregate, might have a material adverse effect on the business,
     condition (financial or other) or prospects of such companies taken as a
     whole (a "Material Adverse Effect"), and, to the best of the Company's
     knowledge, no such proceedings are threatened or contemplated by
     governmental authorities or threatened by others. There is no pending or,
     to the best of the Company's knowledge, threatened legal or governmental
     proceeding that seeks to restrain, enjoin, prevent the consummation of, or
     otherwise challenge the issuance of the Securities to be sold pursuant to
     this Agreement or the consummation of the other


                                        3

     Transactions. The aggregate of all pending legal or governmental
     proceedings to which the Company is a party or of which any of their
     respective property or assets is the subject which are not described in the
     Private Placement Memorandum, including ordinary routine litigation
     incidental to the business, could not reasonably be expected to result in a
     Material Adverse Effect.

               (h)     The Company is not (i) in violation of its charter, by
     laws or formation documents or (ii) in default in any material respect, and
     no event has occurred which, with notice or lapse of time or both, would
     constitute such a default, in the due performance or observance of any
     term, covenant or condition contained in any indenture, mortgage, deed of
     trust, loan agreement, note, lease, license, franchise agreement, permit,
     certificate, contract or other agreement or instrument to which it is a
     party or by which it is bound or to which any of its properties or assets
     is subject.

               (i)     The Company has not sustained, since the date of the
     latest audited financial statements included or incorporated by reference
     in the Private Placement Memorandum, any material loss or interference with
     its business from fire, explosion, flood or other calamity, whether or not
     covered by insurance, or from any strike, job action, slowdown, work
     stoppage, labor dispute or court or governmental action, order or decree (a
     "Material Loss"); and, since such date, there has not been any change in
     the common stock, equity interests, short-term debt or long-term debt of
     the Company or any material adverse change, or any development involving a
     prospective material adverse change, in or affecting the business, general
     affairs, management, position (financial or otherwise), stockholders'
     equity, results of operations, cash flow or earnings of the Company taken
     as a whole, otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in the Private
     Placement Memorandum (a "Material Adverse Change").

               (j)     The financial statements, including the related notes and
     supporting schedules, included or incorporated by reference in the
     Preliminary Private Placement Memorandum and the Private Placement
     Memorandum present fairly the financial condition, results of operations
     and changes in financial position of the Company on the basis stated
     therein at the respective dates or for the respective periods to which they
     apply; such statements and related schedules and notes have been prepared
     in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United
     States ("GAAP") consistently applied throughout the periods involved; the
     supporting schedules, if any, included or incorporated by reference in the
     Private Placement Memorandum present fairly, in accordance with GAAP, the
     information required to be stated therein; and the other financial and
     statistical information and data set forth in the Private Placement
     Memorandum are or will be, in all material respects, accurately presented
     and prepared on a basis consistent with such financial statements

     records of the Company.

               (k)     The statistical, industry and market-related data

     executive officer or officers and principal financial officer or officers,
     as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure.

               (n)     The Company has established and maintains disclosure

     required for the execution, delivery and performance of the Transaction
     Documents by the Company, the issuance of the Securities, the performance
     of the obligations of the Company hereunder and thereunder and the

               (t)     Each of the Company has such authorizations and has made
     all filings with and notices to, all governmental or regulatory authorities
     and self-regulatory organizations and all courts and other tribunals, as
     are necessary to own, lease, license and operate its properties and to
     conduct its business in the manner described in the Private Placement

     Company is in material compliance with all the terms and conditions thereof
     and with the rules and regulations of the authorities and governing bodies
     having jurisdiction with respect

<PAGE>
     thereto, except where the failure to be valid, in full force and effect or
     in compliance would not have a Material Adverse Effect. No event has
     occurred (including, without limitation, the receipt of any notice from any
     authority or governing body) which allows or, after notice or lapse of time
     or both, would allow, revocation, suspension or termination of any such
     Authorization or results or, after notice or lapse of time or both, would
     result in any other material impairment of the rights of the holder of any
     such Authorization except to the extent that such revocation, suspension or
     other impairment would not have a Material Adverse Effect. To the knowledge
     of the Company, no governmental body or agency has threatened to limit,
     suspend or revoke any such Authorization, except where such limitation,
     suspension or revocation would not have a Material Adverse Effect.

               (u)     Neither the Company nor any agent thereof acting on their
     behalf has taken, and none of them will take, any action that might cause
     this Agreement or the issuance or sale of the Notes to violate Regulation T
     (12 C.F.R. Part 220), Regulation U (12 C.F.R. Part 221) or Regulation X (12
     C.F.R. Part 224) of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.

               (v)     The Company has good and marketable title in fee simple
     to, or valid and enforceable leasehold estates in, all items of real and
     personal property owned or leased by it, in each case free and clear of all
     liens, charges, claims, encumbrances, pledges, security interests, defects
     or other restrictions or equities of any kind whatsoever, except such as
     are described in the Private Placement Memorandum.

               (w)     The Company carries, or is covered by, insurance in such
     amounts and covering such risks as is adequate for the conduct of its
     respective businesses and the value of its respective properties and as is
     customary for companies engaged in similar businesses in similar
     industries.

               (x)     The Company owns or possesses adequate rights to use all
     patents, patent applications, trademarks, service marks, trade names,
     trademark registrations, service mark registrations, copyrights and
     licenses necessary for the conduct of its business (the "Intellectual
     Property") and has no reason to believe that the conduct of its business
     will conflict with, and has not received any notice of any claim of
     conflict with, any such rights of others, in each case except as could not
     reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. The Company has
     taken reasonable security measures to protect the secrecy, confidentiality
     and value of its Intellectual Property and other proprietary information in
     all respects.

               (y)     No relationship, direct or indirect, exists between or
     among the Company on the one hand, and the directors, officers,
     stockholders, customers or suppliers of the Company on the other hand,
     which is required to be described in the Private Placement Memorandum which
     is not so described.

     "Code"); and each "pension plan" for which the Company would have any
     liability that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code

     income and franchise tax returns required to be filed through the date
     hereof, has paid all taxes due thereon and has established adequate

               (dd)     All indebtedness of the Company that will be repaid with
     the proceeds of the issuance and sale of the Notes was incurred, and the
     indebtedness represented by the Notes is being incurred, for proper

               (ee)     No event has occurred nor has any circumstance arisen

     constitute a default or an event of default under the Note as summarized in
     the Private Placement Memorandum.

               (ff)     Assuming the accuracy of the representations and
     warranties of the Purchaser contained in Section 3 and the compliance of
     the Purchaser with the agreements set forth herein, it is not necessary, in
     connection with the issuance and sale of the Securities, in the manner
     contemplated by Transaction Documents and the Private Placement Memorandum,
     to register the Securities under the Securities Act.

               (gg)     None of the Company or any of its Affiliates (as defined

     otherwise negotiated in respect of any "security" (as defined in the
     Securities Act) which is, or would be, integrated with the sale of any of
     the Securities in a manner that would require the registration under the
     Securities Act of any of the Securities.

               (ii)     Neither the Company nor, to the Company's knowledge, any
     of the Affiliates of the Company, have taken, directly or indirectly, any
     action designed to cause or result in, or which has constituted or which
     might reasonably be expected to constitute, the stabilization or
     manipulation of the price of the Securities to facilitate the sale or
     resale of such securities.

               (jj)     The Company has not sold or issued any security of the

     meanings specified in Section 2(a)(3) of the Securities Act.

     to any person who is not whom it reasonably believes to be a Qualified

               (ll)     Each certificate signed by any officer of the Company
     and delivered to the Purchaser or counsel to the Purchaser shall be deemed
     to be a representation and warranty by the Company to the Purchaser as to
     the matters covered thereby.

          3.     REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND AGREEMENTS OF THE PURCHASER.
The Purchaser represents and warrants to, and agrees with, the Company that it:

               (a)     is not acquiring the Notes with a view to any
     distribution thereof or with any present intention of offering or selling
     any of the Notes in a transaction that would violate the Securities Act or
     the securities laws of any State of the United States or any other
     applicable jurisdiction.

               (b)     is a QIB or Accredited Investor, as reflected in the
     Investor Questionnaire delivered simultaneous herewith, and the information
     contained in said Investor Questionnaire is true and correct.

               (c)     is aware that the Notes are speculative and that it may
     lose its entire investment and it can afford to bear the risks of an
     investment in the Company, including the risk of losing its entire
     investment.

     information concerning the Company and any other relevant matters as
     Purchaser has requested, and (ii) been given the opportunity to ask
     questions of and receive answers from the Company concerning the terms and
     conditions of the offering of the Notes.

               (e)     is aware that its must bear the economic risk of its
     investment in the Company for an indefinite period of time because: (1) the
     Notes have not been registered under the Securities Act, or qualified under
     the state securities laws of any state, and therefore cannot be sold,
     assigned or otherwise disposed of unless appropriate exemptions from such
     registration or qualification requirements are available; (2) the Company
     will place a legend on the certificates evidencing the Notes stating that
     the Notes have not been registered under the Act or any state securities
     laws and setting forth the limitations on resale contained above and the
     Company will also require that its registrar and transfer agent make a
     notation of such restrictions in its appropriate records; and (3) there is
     no public market for such Notes. The Purchaser further understands and
     agrees that the Company will not honor any attempt by Purchaser to sell,
     transfer of otherwise dispose of the Notes in the absence of either an
     effective registration statement and qualification under applicable Blue
     Sky laws or exemptions therefrom.

     confirm such notice in writing, of the happening of any event prior to the
     Closing Date that makes any statement of a material fact made or
     incorporated by reference in the Private Placement Memorandum untrue or
     that requires any additions to, or changes in, the Private Placement
     Memorandum or any Exchange Act Document in order to make the statements
     therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
     misleading;

               (b)     to advise the Purchaser promptly of any proposal to amend
     or supplement the Private Placement Memorandum or any Exchange Act

     the Company, to amend or supplement the Private Placement Memorandum in
     order that the Private Placement Memorandum and the Exchange Act Documents
     will not, as of their respective dates, as of the date of this Agreement
     and as of the Closing Date, include an untrue statement of a material fact
     or omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements
     therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
     misleading, to promptly notify the Purchaser and promptly prepare or, with

     such jurisdictions for as long as may be necessary to complete the Private
     Placement; provided that, in connection therewith, the Company shall not be

     or the initiation of any proceeding by any state securities commission or
     other federal or state regulatory authority for such purpose. The Company
     shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to prevent the issuance of
     any stop order or order suspending the qualification or exemption of any of
     the Notes under any state securities or Blue Sky laws, and if at any time

     authority shall issue an order suspending the qualification or exemption of
