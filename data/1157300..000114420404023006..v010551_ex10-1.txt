existing  and in good  standing  under the laws of the State of Delaware and has
all corporate powers and all  governmental  licenses,  authorizations,  permits,
consents and approvals  required to carry on its business as now conducted.  ACB
is duly qualified or authorized to do business as a foreign  corporation  and is
in good standing under the laws of each  jurisdiction in which it owns or leases
real property and each other  jurisdiction  in which the conduct of its business
or the ownership of its properties requires such qualification or authorization,
except  where the failure to be so qualified  would not have a material  adverse
effect on the  business,  assets or financial  condition  of Company  taken as a
whole  ("Material  Adverse  Effect").   ACB  has  heretofore  delivered  to  the
Purchasers  true and complete  copies of the  Certificate of  Incorporation,  as
amended, and By-laws, each as currently in effect.

Section  3.2  Authorization;   No  Agreements.   The  execution,   delivery  and
performance by Seller of this  Agreement,  the  performance  of its  obligations
hereunder,  and the  consummation of the  transactions  contemplated  hereby are
within  the  Seller's  powers.  Seller has full legal  capacity  to execute  and
deliver this Agreement and perform his obligations hereunder. This Agreement has
been duly and validly executed and delivered by the Seller and is a legal, valid
and binding obligation of the Seller,  enforceable  against Seller in accordance
with its terms.  The execution,  delivery and  performance by the Seller of this
Agreement  does  not  violate  any  contractual  restriction  contained  in  any
agreement  which  binds or affects  or  purports  to bind or affect the  Seller.
Neither the Seller nor the Company is a party to any agreement, written or oral,
creating  rights in respect of any of the Shares on the part of any third  party
or  relating  to the voting of the  Shares.  Seller is the  lawful  owner of the
Shares, free and clear of all security interests, liens, encumbrances,  equities
and other charges.  Seller further  represents that it does not beneficially own
any options or warrants or other rights to purchase  shares of the Common Stock.

                                       2

There  are no  outstanding  or  authorized  options,  warrants,  rights,  calls,
commitments,  conversion  rights,  rights of exchange or other agreements of any
character, contingent or otherwise, providing for the purchase, issuance or sale
of any of the  Shares,  or any  arrangements  that  require or permit any of the
Shares to be voted by or at the discretion of anyone other than the Seller,  and
there are no restrictions of any kind on the transfer of any of the Shares other
than (a)  restrictions  on transfer  imposed by the  Securities  Act of 1933, as
amended  (the  "Securities  Act") and (b)  restrictions  on transfer  imposed by
applicable state securities or "blue sky" laws.

Section 3.3 Capitalization.

(a) The authorized  capital stock of the Company consists of 100,000,000  shares
of the Common Stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of which 34,156,215 shares are
issued and  outstanding.  All of the issued  and  outstanding  shares of capital
stock of the Company have been duly  authorized and validly issued and are fully
paid and  nonassessable  and were not issued in violation of any  preemptive  or
similar rights. All of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of the

applicable  federal and state  securities laws. No securities of the Company are
entitled to preemptive or similar  rights,  and no person,  natural or otherwise

contemplated hereby. There are no outstanding options,  warrants,  script rights
to subscribe to, calls or commitments of any character  whatsoever  relating to,
or securities,  rights or obligations  convertible into or exchangeable  for, or

Common Stock, or contracts, commitments, understandings or arrangements by which
the  Company is or may  become  bound to issue  additional  shares of the Common
Stock, or securities or rights  convertible or  exchangeable  into shares of the
Common Stock.  The issuance and sale of the Shares will not obligate the Company
to issue shares of the Common  Stock or other  securities  to any Person  (other
than the  Purchaser)  and shall not  result in a right of any  holder of Company
securities  to adjust the  exercise,  conversion,  exchange or reset price under
such securities.

(b) There are no  outstanding  obligations,  contingent or otherwise,  of ACB to
redeem,  purchase  or  otherwise  acquire  or issue any  capital  stock or other

benefit plan or arrangement covering any current or former director,  officer or

Section 3.6 No Liabilities or Debts. There are no liabilities or debts of ACB of
any  kind  whatsoever,   whether  accrued,  contingent,   absolute,  determined,
determinable or otherwise, and there is no existing condition,  situation or set

Seller and ACB against  attorneys  Neil Kaufman and John Penn,  d/b/a  Kaufman &
Associates,  L.L.C.  for  damages  and the  return  of  certain  documents.  The
defendants have  threatened to  counterclaim  against ACB and Seller for various
violations, including securities law violations, none of which have any merit in
the opinion of counsel. Neither the Company, nor any officer, key employee or 5%
or more stockholder,  including the Seller,  of the Company,  in his, her or its
capacity as such,  is in default  with respect to any order,  writ,  injunction,

government  agency.  The Commission has not issued any stop order or other order
suspending the effectiveness of any registration  statement filed by the Company

returns are true,  correct and complete in all material  respects in relation to
any and all applicable taxes, fees, levies, duties, tariffs,  imposts, and other
charges of any kind (together with any and all interest, penalties, additions to
tax  and  additional  amounts  imposed  with  respect  thereto)  imposed  by any
government  or taxing  authority,  including  taxes or other  charges on or with
respect  to income,  franchises,  windfall  or other  profits,  gross  receipts,

audit of its tax  returns,  and has not  received  any notice of  deficiency  or
assessment  from any taxing  authority with respect to liability for taxes which
has not been  fully  paid or  finally  settled.  There  have been no  waivers of
statutes of  limitations  by ACB with  respect to any tax  returns.  ACB has not
filed a request  with the  Internal  Revenue  Service for changes in  accounting
methods within the last three years which change would affect the accounting for
tax purposes,  directly or indirectly,  of its business. ACB has not executed an
extension  or  waiver  of  any  statute  of  limitations  on the  assessment  or
collection  of any taxes  due  (excluding  such  statutes  that  relate to years
currently under  examination by the Internal Revenue Service or other applicable
taxing authorities) that is currently in effect.

Section  3.9  Internal  Accounting  Controls;  Sarbanes-Oxley  Act of 2002.  The
Company is in compliance  with the  requirements  of the  Sarbanes-Oxley  Act of
2002. The Company maintains a system of internal  accounting controls sufficient
to provide reasonable assurance that (i) transactions are executed in accordance
with  management's  general or specific  authorizations,  (ii)  transactions are
recorded  as  necessary  to  permit  preparation  of  financial   statements  in
conformity  with GAAP and to  maintain  asset  accountability,  (iii)  access to
assets is permitted  only in accordance  with  management's  general or specific
authorization,  and (iv) the recorded accountability for assets is compared with
the existing assets at reasonable intervals and appropriate action is taken with
respect to any differences.  The Company has established disclosure controls and
procedures  (as defined in Exchange Act Rules  13a-15(e) and  15d-15(e)) for the
Company and designed  such  disclosures  controls and  procedures to ensure that
material  information  relating to the Company,  is made known to the certifying
officers by others  within  those  entities,  particularly  during the period in
which  the  Company's  Form  10-KSB  or  10-QSB,  as the case  may be,  is being
prepared.  The Company's certifying officers have evaluated the effectiveness of
the Company's  controls and procedures as of the date of its most recently filed
periodic report (such date, the "Evaluation Date"). The Company presented in its
most recently filed periodic report the  conclusions of the certifying  officers
about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures based on their
evaluations as of the Evaluation  Date.  Since the Evaluation  Date,  there have
been no significant  changes in the Company's internal controls (as such term is
defined in Item  307(b) of  Regulation  S-K under the  Exchange  Act) or, to the
Company's  knowledge,  in other  factors  that  could  significantly  affect the
Company's  internal controls.  ACB's auditors,  at all relevant times, have been
duly  registered in good standing with the Public Company  Accounting  Oversight
Board.

Section 3.10  Solvency;  Indebtedness.  Based on the financial  condition of the
Company as of the Closing  Date:  (i) the fair  saleable  value of the Company's
assets  equals or exceeds  the amount  that will be required to be paid on or in
respect of the Company's  existing debts and other liabilities  (including known
contingent  liabilities)  as they  mature;  (ii)  the  Company's  assets  do not
constitute  unreasonably  small capital to carry on its business for the current
fiscal year as now  conducted;  and (iii) the current  cash flow of the Company,
together with the proceeds the Company would  receive,  were it to liquidate all
of its assets, after taking into account all anticipated uses of the cash, would
be  sufficient to pay all amounts on or in respect of its debt when such amounts
are  required to be paid.  The Company does not intend to incur debts beyond its
ability to pay such debts as they  mature.  The Company has no  knowledge of any
facts  or  circumstances  which  lead  it to  believe  that  it  will  file  for
reorganization or liquidation under the bankruptcy or reorganization laws of any
jurisdiction  within one (1) year from the  Closing  Date.  The SEC  Reports set
forth as of the dates thereof all outstanding secured and unsecured indebtedness
of the Company, or for which the Company has commitments.  The Company is not in

outstanding liabilities, obligations or indebtedness of the Company whatsoever.

has not taken any action  that would  cause the  Purchaser  to be liable for any
such fees or commissions.  The Company and Seller agree that the Purchaser shall
have no  obligation  with respect to any fees or with respect to any claims made
by or on behalf of any Person, for fees of the type contemplated by this Section
3.11 and Seller shall indemnify and hold the Purchaser and the Company  harmless
from any fees, costs or liabilities of any kind incurred by the Purchaser or the
Company in connection therewith.

Section 3.12 Disclosure.  The Company and Seller confirm that neither it nor any
other  Person  acting on its behalf has  provided  any of the  Purchaser  or its
agents or counsel with any  information  that  constitutes  or might  constitute
material,  nonpublic information  concerning the Company. The Company and Seller
understand   and  confirm  that  the  Purchaser   will  rely  on  the  foregoing
representations in effecting any transactions in securities of the Company.  All
disclosure provided to the Purchaser regarding the Company, its business and the
transactions  contemplated  hereby,  furnished by or on behalf of the Company or
the Seller with respect to the  representations  and warranties made herein, are
true and correct with respect to such  representations and warranties and do not

International  Money Laundering  Abatement and  Anti-Terrorist  Financing Act of

Section 3.30  Misrepresentation.  No representation or warranty of the Seller or
the Company  contained in this  Agreement  or in any  schedule  hereto or in any
certificate  or other  instrument  furnished  by the  Seller  to the  Purchasers
pursuant to the terms  hereof,  knowingly  contains  any untrue  statement  of a

statements contained herein or therein not misleading.

                                    ARTICLE 4
                        REPRESENTATIONS OF THE PURCHASER

The Purchasers  represent and warrant,  each solely as to itself, to the Seller,
as follows:

Section 4.1 Execution and Delivery.  The execution,  delivery and performance by
the  Purchaser's  execution  and  delivery  of this  Agreement  is  within  such
Purchaser's powers and does not violate any contractual restriction contained in
any  agreement  which  binds  or  affects  or  purports  to bind or  affect  the
Purchasers.

Section 4.2 Binding Effect.  This Agreement,  when executed and delivered by the
Purchasers shall be irrevocable and will constitute the legal, valid and binding
obligations  of each of the  Purchasers  enforceable  against each  Purchaser in
accordance  with its terms,  except as may be limited by applicable  bankruptcy,
insolvency,   moratorium  and  other  laws  of  general  application   affecting
enforcement  of  creditors'  rights  generally or general  principles  of equity
(regardless  of whether such  enforceability  is  considered  in a proceeding in
equity or at law).

Section 4.3 Investment Purpose.  Each Purchaser represents that it is purchasing
the Shares for its own account,  with the intention of holding the Shares,  with
no present  intention  of  dividing or allowing  others to  participate  in this
investment or of reselling or otherwise  participating,  directly or indirectly,
in a  distribution  of the  Shares,  and shall not make any sale,  transfer,  or
pledge thereof without  registration under the Securities Act and any applicable
securities laws of any state unless an exemption from  registration is available
under those laws. The Purchased  Shares delivered to the Purchasers shall bear a
restrictive  legend  indicating  that  they have not been  registered  under the
Securities Act of 1933 and are  "restricted  securities" as that term is defined
in Rule 144 under the Act.

Section 4.4 Investment Representation. The Purchasers each represent that it has
adequate  means of providing for its current needs and has no need for liquidity
in this  investment  in the  Shares.  The  Purchasers  represents  that it is an
"accredited  investor"  as defined in Rule 501(a) of  Regulation  D  promulgated
under the Securities Act. The Purchaser has no reason to anticipate any material
change in its financial  condition for the foreseeable future. Each Purchaser is
financially  able to bear the economic  risk of this  investment,  including the
ability to hold the  Shares  indefinitely  or to afford a  complete  loss of its
investment in the Shares.

Section  4.5  Investment  Experience.  Each  Purchaser  has such  knowledge  and
experience in financial and business  matters as to be capable of evaluating the
merits and risks of an investment in the Shares.

Section 4.6 Opportunity to Ask Questions. Each Purchaser has had a full and fair
opportunity to make inquiries  about the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
to discuss the same and all related matters with its own independent counsel and
its own  accountants  and tax  advisers.  Each  Purchaser  has  been  given  the
opportunity to ask questions of, and receive answers from Seller  concerning the
terms and  conditions of this  Agreement and to obtain such  additional  written
information  about ACB to the extent Seller  possesses  such  information or can
acquire  it  without   unreasonable  effort  or  expense.   Notwithstanding  the
foregoing, each Purchaser has had the opportunity to conduct its own independent
investigation.

date made;

            (iii) any and all losses, liabilities,  obligations,  damages, costs

                                       13
<PAGE>

      (b) The Purchasers each hereby agrees to indemnify and hold the Seller and

            (i) any and all Losses based upon, attributable to or resulting from
the  failure of any  representation  or  warranty  of the  Purchasers  set forth

            (ii) any and all Losses  based upon,  attributable  to or  resulting

Indemnification Procedures.

      In the event that any legal  proceedings  shall be  instituted or that any
claim or demand  ("Claim")  shall be  asserted by any person in respect of which
payment may be sought  hereunder,  the  indemnified  party shall  reasonably and
promptly  cause  written  notice of the  assertion  of any Claim of which it has
knowledge which is covered by this indemnity to be forwarded to the indemnifying
party.  The  indemnifying  party  shall have the right,  at its sole  option and
expense,  to be represented  by counsel of its choice,  which must be reasonably
satisfactory to the indemnified party, and to defend against,  negotiate, settle
or otherwise deal with any Claim which relates to any Losses indemnified against
hereunder. If the indemnifying party elects to defend against, negotiate, settle
or otherwise deal with any Claim which relates to any Losses indemnified against
hereunder,  it shall within five (5) business days (or sooner,  if the nature of
the Claim so requires)  notify the indemnified  party of its intent to do so. If
the  indemnifying  party  elects  not to defend  against,  negotiate,  settle or
otherwise  deal with any Claim which relates to any Losses  indemnified  against
hereunder,  fails to notify  the  indemnified  party of its  election  as herein
provided or contests its obligation to indemnify the indemnified  party for such
Losses  under  this  Agreement,   the  indemnified  party  may  defend  against,
negotiate,  settle or otherwise deal with such Claim. If the  indemnified  party
defends any Claim,  then the indemnifying  party shall reimburse the indemnified
party for the  Expenses  of  defending  such Claim upon  submission  of periodic
bills.  If the  indemnifying  party shall  assume the defense of any Claim,  the
indemnified party may participate,  at his or its own expense, in the defense of


                                       14
<PAGE>

such Claim; provided,  however, that such indemnified party shall be entitled to
participate  in any such  defense  with  separate  counsel at the expense of the
indemnifying party if, (i) so requested by the indemnifying party to participate
or (ii) in the  reasonable  opinion  of  counsel  to the  indemnified  party,  a
conflict or potential  conflict  exists  between the  indemnified  party and the
indemnifying party that would make such separate representation  advisable;  and
provided,  further, that the indemnifying party shall not be required to pay for
more than one such counsel for all  indemnified  parties in connection  with any
Claim. The parties hereto agree to cooperate fully with each other in connection
with the defense, negotiation or settlement of any such Claim.

      After any final  judgment  or award  shall have been  rendered by a court,
arbitration  board or  administrative  agency of competent  jurisdiction and the
expiration of the time in which to appeal therefrom,  or a settlement shall have
been consummated, or the indemnified party and the indemnifying party shall have
arrived at a mutually binding  agreement with respect to a Claim hereunder,  the
indemnified party shall forward to the indemnifying party notice of any sums due
and owing by the  indemnifying  party pursuant to this Agreement with respect to
such matter and the indemnifying  party shall be required to pay all of the sums
so due and  owing to the  indemnified  party  by wire  transfer  of  immediately
available funds within 10 business days after the date of such notice.

      The failure of the indemnified  party to give reasonably  prompt notice of
any Claim shall not release,  waive or otherwise affect the indemnifying party's
obligations  with  respect  thereto  except to the extent that the  indemnifying
party can demonstrate actual loss and prejudice as a result of such failure.

Section 6.6 Reasonable  Efforts.  Each party agrees to use with all due dispatch
its  reasonable  best efforts to take, or cause to be taken,  all actions and to
do, or cause to be done,  all things  necessary or advisable to  consummate  and
make effective as promptly as practicable the transactions  contemplated by this
Agreement  and to  cooperate  with the  other  parties  in  connection  with the
foregoing.  Each  party  further  agrees not to  undertake  any course of action
inconsistent  with the  satisfaction  of the  conditions  to  Closing  set forth
herein,  and to do all such acts and take all such measures as may be reasonable
to comply, and be in compliance, with the representations, warranties, covenants
and agreements contained in this Agreement.

Section 6.7 Cooperation. In the event that any investigation,  inquiry, lawsuit,
administrative  proceeding or any other  proceeding is commenced with respect to
the Company,  the Seller shall fully  cooperate  with and provide all applicable
documents  to, the  Company  and  Purchasers,  immediately  upon  request of the
Company or the Purchasers.

Section 6.8 Board of  Directors.  The Seller shall cause the Company to take all
necessary  action to cause the Board of  Directors,  as of the closing  date, to
appoint Ms.  Lianqin Qu as a director of the Company.  Simon Piers Thurlow shall
resign from all  positions  with the  Company,  including  as  president,  chief
financial officer and director, immediately after the Closing Date.
