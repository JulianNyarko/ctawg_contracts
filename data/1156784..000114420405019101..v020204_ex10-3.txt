Escrow Agent hereunder, or if at any time Escrow Agent is unable to determine,

hereof, appointed a successor Escrow Agent to act hereunder, then Escrow Agent
may, in its sole discretion, take either or both of the following actions:

                  i. Suspend the performance of any of its obligations

invest the Escrow Funds in accordance with Section 8 hereof; and/or

                  ii. Petition (by means of an interpleader action or any other
appropriate method) any court of competent jurisdiction in any venue convenient
to Escrow Agent, for instructions with respect to such dispute or uncertainty,
and to the extent required by law, pay into such court, for holding and
disposition in accordance with the instructions of such court, all funds held by
it in the Escrow Funds, after deduction and payment to Escrow Agent of all fees
and expenses (including court costs and attorneys' fees) payable to, incurred
by, or expected to be incurred by Escrow Agent in connection with performance of
its duties and the exercise of its rights hereunder.

                  iii. Escrow Agent shall have no liability to the Company, the
Investor, or any person with respect to any such suspension of performance or
disbursement into court, specifically including any liability or claimed
liability that may arise, or be alleged to have arisen, out of or as a result of
any delay in the disbursement of funds held in the Escrow Funds or any delay in
with respect to any other action required or requested of Escrow Agent.

            8. Investment of Escrow Funds. The Escrow Agent shall deposit the
Escrow Funds in a non-interest bearing money market account.

received, in a non-interest bearing money market account.

            9. Resignation and Removal of Escrow Agent. Escrow Agent may resign
from the performance of its duties hereunder at any time by giving thirty (30)
days' prior written notice to the parties or may be removed, with or without

notice to Escrow Agent as provided herein below. Upon any such notice of
resignation or removal, the representatives of the Investor and the Company
identified in Sections 13a.(iv) and 13b.(iv), below, jointly shall appoint a
successor Escrow Agent hereunder, which shall be a commercial bank, trust
company or other financial institution with a combined capital and surplus in
excess of $10,000,000.00. Upon the acceptance in writing of any appointment of
Escrow Agent hereunder by a successor Escrow Agent, such successor Escrow Agent
shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers,
privileges and duties of the retiring Escrow Agent, and the retiring Escrow
Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations under this Escrow
Agreement, but shall not be discharged from any liability for actions taken as
Escrow Agent hereunder prior to such succession. After any retiring Escrow
Agent's resignation or removal, the provisions of this Escrow Agreement shall
inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while
it was Escrow Agent under this Escrow Agreement. The retiring Escrow Agent shall

by it in the Escrow Funds to the successor Escrow Agent, after making copies of
such records as the retiring Escrow Agent deems advisable and after deduction
and payment to the retiring Escrow Agent of all fees and expenses (including
court costs and attorneys' fees) payable to, incurred by, or expected to be
incurred by the retiring Escrow Agent in connection with the performance of its
duties and the exercise of its rights hereunder.

      10. Liability of Escrow Agent.

            a. Escrow Agent shall have no liability or obligation with respect
to the Escrow Funds except for Escrow Agent's willful misconduct or gross
negligence. Escrow Agent's sole responsibility shall be for the safekeeping,
investment, and disbursement of the Escrow Funds in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement. Escrow Agent shall have no implied duties or obligations and
shall not be charged with knowledge or notice or any fact or circumstance not
specifically set forth herein. Escrow Agent may rely upon any instrument, not
only as to its due execution, validity and effectiveness, but also as to the
truth and accuracy of any information contained therein, which Escrow Agent
shall in good faith believe to be genuine, to have been signed or presented by
the person or parties purporting to sign the same and conform to the provisions
of this Agreement. In no event shall Escrow Agent be liable for incidental,
indirect, special, and consequential or punitive damages. Escrow Agent shall not
be obligated to take any legal action or commence any proceeding in connection
with the Escrow Funds, any account in which Escrow Funds are deposited, this
Agreement or the Standby Equity Distribution Agreement, or to appear in,
prosecute or defend any such legal action or proceeding. Escrow Agent may
consult legal counsel selected by it in the event of any dispute or question as
to construction of any of the provisions hereof or of any other agreement or its
duties hereunder, or relating to any dispute involving any party hereto, and
shall incur no liability and shall be fully indemnified from any liability
whatsoever in acting in accordance with the opinion or instructions of such
counsel. The Company and the Investor jointly and severally shall promptly pay,
upon demand, the reasonable fees and expenses of any such counsel and Escrow
Agent is hereby authorized to pay such fees and expenses from funds held in
escrow.

            b. The Escrow Agent is hereby authorized, in its sole discretion, to
comply with orders issued or process entered by any court with respect to the
Escrow Funds, without determination by the Escrow Agent of such court's
jurisdiction in the matter. If any portion of the Escrow Funds is at any time


                                       5
<PAGE>

attached, garnished or levied upon under any court order, or in case the
payment, assignment, transfer, conveyance or delivery of any such property shall
be stayed or enjoined by any court order, or in any case any order judgment or
decree shall be made or entered by any court affecting such property or any part
thereof, then and in any such event, the Escrow Agent is authorized, in its sole
discretion, to rely upon and comply with any such order, writ judgment or decree
which it is advised by legal counsel selected by it, binding upon it, without
the need for appeal or other action; and if the Escrow Agent complies with any
such order, writ, judgment or decree, it shall not be liable to any of the
parties hereto or to any other person or entity by reason of such compliance
even though such order, writ judgment or decree may be subsequently reversed,
modified, annulled, set aside or vacated.

            11. Indemnification of Escrow Agent. From and at all times after the
date of this Agreement, the parties jointly and severally, shall, to the fullest
extent permitted by law and to the extent provided herein, indemnify and hold
harmless Escrow Agent and each director, officer, employee, attorney, agent and
affiliate of Escrow Agent (collectively, the "Indemnified Parties") against any
and all actions, claims (whether or not valid), losses, damages, liabilities,
costs and expenses of any kind or nature whatsoever (including without
limitation reasonable attorney's fees, costs and expenses) incurred by or
asserted against any of the Indemnified Parties from and after the date hereof,
whether direct, indirect or consequential, as a result of or arising from or in
any way relating to any claim, demand, suit, action, or proceeding (including
any inquiry or investigation) by any person, including without limitation the
parties to this Agreement, whether threatened or initiated, asserting a claim
for any legal or equitable remedy against any person under any statute or
regulation, including, but not limited to, any federal or state securities laws,
or under any common law or equitable cause or otherwise, arising from or in
connection with the negotiation, preparation, execution, performance or failure
of performance of this Agreement or any transaction contemplated herein, whether
or not any such Indemnified Party is a party to any such action or proceeding,
suit or the target of any such inquiry or investigation; provided, however, that
no Indemnified Party shall have the right to be indemnified hereunder for
liability finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction, subject to no
further appeal, to have resulted solely from the gross negligence or willful
misconduct of such Indemnified Party. If any such action or claim shall be
brought or asserted against any Indemnified Party, such Indemnified Party shall
promptly notify the Company and the Investor hereunder in writing, and the
Investor and the Company shall assume the defense thereof, including the
employment of counsel and the payment of all expenses. Such Indemnified Party
shall, in its sole discretion, have the right to employ separate counsel (who
may be selected by such Indemnified Party in its sole discretion) in any such
action and to participate in the defense thereof, and the fees and expenses of
such counsel shall be paid by such Indemnified Party, except that the Investor
and/or the Company shall be required to pay such fees and expense if (a) the
Investor or the Company agree to pay such fees and expenses, or (b) the Investor
and/or the Company shall fail to assume the defense of such action or proceeding
or shall fail, in the sole discretion of such Indemnified Party, to employ
counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party in any such action or
proceeding, (c) the Investor and the Company are the plaintiff in any such
action or proceeding or (d) the named or potential parties to any such action or
proceeding (including any potentially impleaded parties) include both

available to it which are different from or additional to those available to the
Company or the Investor. The Investor and the Company shall be jointly and
severally liable to pay fees and expenses of counsel pursuant to the preceding
sentence, except that any obligation to pay under clause (a) shall apply only to
the party so agreeing. All such fees and expenses payable by the Company and/or
the Investor pursuant to the foregoing sentence shall be paid from time to time
as incurred, both in advance of and after the final disposition of such action
or claim. The obligations of the parties under this section shall survive any
termination of this Agreement, and resignation or removal of the Escrow Agent
shall be independent of any obligation of Escrow Agent.
