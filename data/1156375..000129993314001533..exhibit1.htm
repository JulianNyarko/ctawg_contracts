<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt; text-indent: 4%">This Retention Agreement (&#147;Agreement&#148;) is made as of September&nbsp;29, 2014 (&#147;Effective Date&#148;)
between Chicago Mercantile Exchange Inc. (the &#147;Company&#148;), a Delaware corporation, and Jamie Parisi
(&#147;Employee&#148;).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt; text-indent: 4%">WHEREAS, Employee, who is Chief Financial Officer of the Company and a member of the Company&#146;s
Executive Team, notified the Company that he is voluntarily retiring from employment with the
Company;


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt; text-indent: 4%">WHEREAS, the Company is seeking Employee&#146;s commitment to remain employed with the Company
through December&nbsp;31, 2104 in order to provide for an orderly transition of the CFO duties to
Employee&#146;s successor;


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt; text-indent: 4%">WHEREAS, Employee is agreeable to remaining employed with the Company through December&nbsp;31,
2014 in return for the consideration set forth in this Agreement;


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt; text-indent: 4%">NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants set forth below, the parties agree as
follows:


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt">1.&nbsp;<U>Termination of Employment</U>. Employee will remain employed with the Company through
December&nbsp;31, 2014, the effective date of his retirement (&#147;Retirement Date&#148;). Employee will remain
the Chief Financial Officer (&#147;CFO&#148;) until the earlier of his Retirement Date or the date on which
the CFO duties are completely transitioned to Employee&#146;s successor and Employee&#146;s successor is
appointed as the CFO, which such date shall be determined by the Company in its sole discretion.
Employee will perform all duties as assigned by the Company, including the CFO duties while
Employee remains in the CFO role and duties related to the transition of the CFO duties to
Employee&#146;s successor, through the Retirement Date.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt">2.&nbsp;<U>Consideration</U>. In consideration for Employee&#146;s releases, promises, and representations
in this Agreement, including, but not limited to Employee&#146;s agreement to remain employed through
the Retirement Date and to assist with the transition of the CFO duties, the Company will provide
Employee with the following, which Employee acknowledges Employee is not entitled to absent this
Agreement:

performance during the 2014 plan year. The bonus will be paid in the normal course of

is considered &#147;nonqualified deferred compensation&#148; under Code Section&nbsp;409A upon or following a
termination of employment unless such termination is also a &#147;separation from service&#148; within the
meaning of Code Section&nbsp;409A and, for purposes of any such provision of this Agreement, references
to a &#147;termination,&#148; &#147;termination of employment&#148; or like terms will mean &#147;separation from service.&#148;&nbsp;
If Employee is deemed on the date of termination to be a &#147;specified employee&#148; within the meaning of
that term under Code Section&nbsp;409A(a)(2)(B), then with regard to any payment or the provision of any
benefit that is considered &#147;nonqualified deferred compensation&#148; under Code Section&nbsp;409A payable on
account of a &#147;separation from service,&#148; such payment or benefit will be made or provided at the
date which is the earlier of (A)&nbsp;the expiration of the six (6)-month period measured from the date
of your &#147;separation from service,&#148; and (B)&nbsp;the date of your death, to the extent required under
Code Section&nbsp;409A.&nbsp; Upon the expiration of the foregoing delay period, all payments and benefits
delayed pursuant to this section will be paid or reimbursed to you in a lump sum and all remaining
payments and benefits due under this Agreement (if any) will be paid or provided in accordance with
the normal payment dates specified for them herein.
