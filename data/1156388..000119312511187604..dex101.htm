authorized, and must not represent to any third party that Contractor is authorized, to make any commitment or otherwise act on behalf of Company. Contractor is not entitled to or eligible for any benefits that Company may make available to its
employees. Because Contractor is an independent contractor, Company will not withhold or make payments for social security, make unemployment insurance or disability insurance contributions, or obtain workers&#146; compensation insurance on behalf
of Contractor. Contractor is solely responsible for filing all tax returns and submitting all payments as required by any federal, state, local, or foreign tax authority arising from the payment of fees to Contractor under this Agreement, and agrees
to do so in a timely manner. Contractor will comply with all applicable federal, state, local, and foreign laws governing self-employed individuals, including laws requiring the payment of taxes, such as income and employment taxes, and social
security, disability, and other contributions. Company will issue Contractor an IRS 1099 Form with respect to the compensation paid hereunder. Contractor will be entirely responsible for payment of any taxes which may be due with regard to the
compensation paid hereunder, and hereby agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Company from and against any liability for any taxes, penalties or interest that may be assessed by any taxing authority with respect to the compensation paid hereunder.

institute a court action, except for requests for injunctive relief pending arbitration, and understand that each is giving up the right to a jury trial. The arbitrator&#146;s award and opinion shall be in writing and in the form typically rendered
in commercial arbitrations. Company will pay any filing fee and the fees and costs of the arbitrator, unless Contractor initiates the claim, in which case the Contractor will only be required to contribute an amount equal to the filing fee for a
