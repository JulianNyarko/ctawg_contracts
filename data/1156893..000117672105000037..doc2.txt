                                 PROMISSORY NOTE

US$200,000.00                                                 February  3,  2005

     FOR  VALUE RECEIVED, the undersigned, LONG DISTANCE BILLING SERVICES, INC.,
a  Nevada  corporation (the "Maker"), hereby promises to pay to the order of NS8
CORPORATION  (the  "Payee", which term includes any subsequent holder hereof) at
Seattle,  Washington  or  at such other place as the Payee may from time to time
hereafter  designate  to  the Maker in writing, on August 1, 2005, the principal
sum  of TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITED STATES DOLLARS AND NO CENTS (US$200,000.00).

     The  unpaid  principal  balance  hereof from time to time outstanding shall
bear  interest  at the rate of 12% per annum.  Interest shall be computed on the
basis  of actual days elapsed and a year of 360 days.  Upon the happening of any
Event  of  Default,  this  Note, at the option of the Payee, shall bear interest
until  paid in full at a rate per annum equal to the rate of interest applicable
immediately  prior  to  such  Event  of  Default  plus  3%.

     Interest  hereon  shall  be  payable  in  arrears  at  final  maturity.

     This  Note may be prepaid by the Maker at any time in whole or from time to
time in part (in minimum partial payments of at least US$10,000) without premium
or  penalty.  Any  prepayment  shall be applied first against accrued and unpaid
interest  and  the  balance  shall  be  applied  against  principal.

     This Note is secured by a Security Agreement dated February 3, 2005 (as the
same  may  hereafter  be  amended,  modified  or  supplemented, or any agreement
entered  into in substitution or replacement therefor, the "Security Agreement")
given  by  the  Maker  to  the  Payee.

     The  occurrence of any one or more of the following events shall constitute
an  Event  of Default, and upon the occurrence of any Event of Default the Payee
may  declare  this
Note to be, and the same shall forthwith become, immediately due and payable and
the  Payee may exercise all rights and remedies under the Security Agreement and
as  may  otherwise  be  allowed  by  law:

     (1)  The  Maker  shall  fail  to  make any payment of principal or interest
          hereon  when  due.

     (2)  The  Maker shall become insolvent or shall generally not pay its debts
          as  they  mature  or  shall  apply  for,  shall  consent  to, or shall
          acquiesce  in  the appointment of a custodian, trustee or receiver for
          the Maker or for a substantial part of the property thereof or, in the
          absence  of  such  application,  consent or acquiescence, a custodian,
          trustee  or  receiver  shall  be  appointed  for  the  Maker  or for a
          substantial  part  of  the  property  thereof;  or  any  bankruptcy,
          reorganization,  debt  arrangement  or  other  proceedings  under  any
          bankruptcy  or  insolvency  law  shall be instituted by or against the
          Maker.

     (3)  The maturity of any material indebtedness of the Maker (other than the
          indebtedness  on  this  Note)  shall be accelerated or the Maker shall
          fail to pay any such material indebtedness when due or, in the case of
          indebtedness  payable  on  demand,  when demanded. For these purposes,
          indebtedness  of  the  Maker  shall  be  deemed material if it exceeds
          US$25,000  as  to any item of indebtedness or in the aggregate for all
          items  of  indebtedness  with  respect  to  which  any  of  the events
          described  in  this  paragraph  has  occurred.

     (4)  Any  default shall occur under the terms of the Security Agreement and
          shall  continue  for more than the period of grace, if any, applicable
          thereto.

     (5)  A  judgment or judgments for the payment of money in excess of the sum
          of  US$25,000 in the aggregate shall be rendered against the Maker and
          the  Maker  shall not discharge the same or provide for its discharge,
          or procure a stay of execution thereof, prior to any execution on such
          judgment,  within  30  days from the date of entry thereof, and within
          said  period  of 30 days, or such longer period during which execution
          shall be stayed, appeal therefrom and cause the execution to be stayed
          during  such  appeal.

     (6)  Any  execution  or  attachment shall be issued whereby any substantial
          part  of  the  property of the Maker shall be taken or attempted to be
          taken  and  the  same  shall not have been vacated or stayed within 30
          days  after  the  issuance  thereof.

TO  CONFLICT  OF  LAWS  PRINCIPLES  THEREOF.

     AT  THE  OPTION OF THE PAYEE THIS NOTE MAY BE ENFORCED IN ANY FEDERAL COURT
OR  WASHINGTON  STATE  COURT  SITTING  IN KING COUNTY, WASHINGTON; AND THE MAKER
CONSENTS TO THE JURISDICTION AND VENUE OF ANY SUCH COURT AND WAIVES ANY ARGUMENT
THAT  THE  VENUE  IN  SUCH FORUMS IS NOT CONVENIENT.  IF THE MAKER COMMENCES ANY
ACTION  IN  ANOTHER  JURISDICTION  OR  VENUE  UNDER  ANY TORT OR CONTRACT THEORY
ARISING  DIRECTLY  OR INDIRECTLY FROM THE RELATIONSHIP CREATED BY THIS NOTE, THE
