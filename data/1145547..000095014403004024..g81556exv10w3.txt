Accounting considerations:

    - The plan provides postretirement benefits for preretirement services.

    - Benefit accruals are required under GAAP (APB 12/FAS 87).

    - Present value of benefit payments are recorded at earlier of retirement
      or at full eligibility (Vesting).


    Based on the recommended benefits, the employer's benefit liability is shown
below.

                      DETAILED BENEFIT PLAN FINANCIAL DATA
                            SALARY CONTINUATION PLAN

This section of the recommendation sets forth the estimated income and expenses
associated with the implementation of the benefit plan and the related
financing strategy. Included in this section are summary data for all plan
participants and detailed data for the individual plan participants.

In order to facilitate your review and understanding of the financial data,
the following is an explanation of the key terms used:

INTEREST ON POLICY EQUITY VALUE-
         The gross income earned on the insurance policy asset based on current
         policy interest rates.

AFTER TAX OPPORTUNITY COST-
         By purchasing the insurance asset that we have recommended, the
         employer would either liquidate an existing earning asset or pass up
         the opportunity to invest the funds elsewhere. This calculation
         measures the after-tax effect of this lost income or "opportunity
         cost." This cost is compounded annually.

LOAD, SURRENDER CHARGES AND MORTALITY COST-
         All of the expenses of providing and maintaining the insurance
         coverage, which are charged against the policy equity value.

SALARY CONTINUATION EXPENSES-
         Fees paid to establish and service the plan.
         The expense accruals for the salary continuation benefit plan use the
         interest method calculation.

INCOME TAXES-
         The estimated current and deferred tax savings on the salary
         continuation benefit plan.

NET PLAN GAIN (LOSS)-
         The estimated annual net gain or loss of providing the benefit plan.

CUMULATIVE NET PLAN GAIN (LOSS)-
         The cumulative total of the annual net plan gain or loss.

The specific assumptions used in preparing the illustrations are as follows:

<Table>
<S>                                                   <C>

  (Weighted average)

Opportunity cost rate................................  5.25%

  results will differ over time as assumed rates fluctuate. BCS does not
