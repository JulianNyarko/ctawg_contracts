<DIV align="justify" style="margin-top: 6pt; margin-left:2%; margin-right:2%; font-size: 10pt">Directors who are also employees of the Company are compensated as officers of the
Company and shall receive no additional compensation for serving as directors.
Each non-employee director shall receive an annual retainer of $30,000 for service
on the Board of Directors. In addition, each non-employee director shall receive
(i) $2,500 for attendance at each regularly scheduled meeting of the Board of
Directors or each committee meeting not otherwise held on the day of a board
meeting or other committee meeting, (ii) $1,000 for attendance at each committee
