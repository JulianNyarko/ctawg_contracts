</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The purposes of this Plan are to encourage and motivate Directors and selected key employees to
contribute to the successful performance of the Corporation and its Subsidiaries and the growth of
the market value of the Corporation&#146;s Common Stock; to achieve a unity of purpose between such
Directors, employees and shareholders by providing ownership opportunities, and, when viewed in
conjunction with potential benefit plans for members of the Board and the Boards of Directors of
some or all of the Subsidiaries, to achieve a unity of purpose between such employees and directors
in the achievement of the Corporation&#146;s primary long term performance objectives; and to retain
such employees by rewarding them with potentially tax-advantageous future compensation. These
objectives will be promoted through the granting of Rights to designated Eligible Employees and
Directors pursuant to the terms of this Plan
