principal or in any other order as determined by SunTrust, in it sole discretion, as permitted by

extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions of
this Note. No amendment, modification, termination or waiver of any provision of this Note, nor
consent to any departure by the Borrower from any term of this Note, shall in any event be
effective unless it is in writing and signed by an authorized officer of SunTrust, and then such
waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose for
which given. If the interest Rate is tied to an external index and the index becomes unavailable
during the term of this loan, SunTrust may, in its sole and absolute discretion, designate a
substitute index with notice to the Borrower. No failure or delay on the part of SunTrust to
exercise any right, power or remedy under this Note shall be construed as a waiver of the right to
exercise the same or any other right at any time. The captions of the paragraphs of this Note are
for convenience only and shall not be deeded to constitute a part hereof or used in construing the
intent of the parties. All representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein
or made in writing by Borrower in connection herewith shall survive the execution and delivery of
this Note and any other agreement, document or writing relating to or arising out of any of the
foregoing. All notices or communications given to Borrower pursuant to the terms of this Note
shall be in writing and given to Borrower at Borrower&#146;s address stated above unless Borrower
notifies SunTrust in writing of a different address. Unless otherwise specifically provided herein
to the contrary, such written notices and communications shall be delivered by hand or overnight
courier service, or mailed by first class mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the Borrower at the
address referred to herein. Any written notice delivered by hand or by overnight courier service
shall be deemed given or received upon receipt. Any written notice delivered by U.S. Mail shall be
deemed given or received on the third (3rd) business day after being deposited in the U.S. Mail.
Notwithstanding any provision of this Note or any loan document executed in connection with this
Note to the contrary, the Borrower and SunTrust intend that no provision of this Note or any loan
document executed in connection with this Note be interpreted, construed, applied, or enforced in a
way that will permit or require the payment or collection of interest in excess of the highest rate
of interest permitted to be paid or collected by the laws of the jurisdiction indicated below, or
federal law if federal law preempts the law of such jurisdiction with respect to this transaction
(the &#147;Maximum Permitted Rate&#148;). If, however, any such provision is so interpreted, construed,
applied, or enforced, Borrower and SunTrust intend (a)&nbsp;that such provision automatically shall be
deemed revised so as to require payment only of interest at the Maximum Permitted Rate; and (b)&nbsp;if
interest payments in excess of the Maximum Permitted Rate have been received, that the amount of
such excess shall be deemed credited retroactively in reduction of the then-outstanding principal
amount of this obligation, together with interest at the Maximum Permitted Rate. In connection with
all calculations to determine the Maximum Permitted Rate, the Borrower and SunTrust intend a that
all charges be excluded to the extent they are properly excludable under the usury laws of such
jurisdiction or the United States, as they from time to time are determined to apply to this
obligation; and (b)&nbsp;that all charges that may be spread in the manner provided by statute
 of the
jurisdiction indicated or any similar law, be so spread.
