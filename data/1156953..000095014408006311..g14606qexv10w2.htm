</DIV>


<DIV align="JUSTIFY" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>THIS AGREEMENT </B>is effective as of June&nbsp;1, 2008 by and between <B>GATEWAY BANK &#038; TRUST CO., </B>a
North Carolina banking corporation (hereinafter referred to as the &#147;Bank&#148;) and <B>MATTHEW D. WHITE</B>, an
individual resident of Virginia (hereinafter referred to as the &#147;Officer&#148;).
</DIV>

<DIV align="JUSTIFY" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For and in consideration of their mutual promises, covenants and conditions hereinafter set
forth, and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which hereby is
acknowledged, the parties agree as follows:
</DIV>

<DIV align="JUSTIFY" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.&nbsp;<U><B>Employment</B></U>. The Bank agrees to employ the Officer and the Officer agrees to accept
employment upon the terms and conditions stated herein as the Treasurer of the Bank. The Officer
shall render such administrative and management services to the Bank as are customarily performed
by persons situated in a similar executive capacity. The Officer shall promote the business of the
Bank and perform such other duties as shall, from time to time, be reasonably assigned by the Chief
Executive Officer of the Bank. Upon the request of the Chief Executive Officer, the Officer shall
disclose all business activities or commercial pursuits in which Officer is engaged, other than
Bank duties.
</DIV>

<DIV align="JUSTIFY" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.&nbsp;<U><B>Compensation</B></U>. The Bank shall pay the Officer during the term of this Agreement, as
compensation for all services rendered by the Officer to the Bank, a base salary at the rate of
$175,000 per annum, payable in cash not less frequently than monthly. The rate of such salary
shall be reviewed by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Bank (the
&#147;Committee&#148;) not less often than annually and the Committee may increase, but shall not decrease,
such rate during the term of this Agreement. Such rate of salary, or increased rate of salary, as
the case may be, may be further increased from time to time in such amounts as the Committee, in
its discretion, may decide. In determining salary increases, the Committee shall compensate the
Officer for increases in the cost of living and may also provide for performance or merit
increases. Participation in the Bank&#146;s incentive compensation, deferred compensation,
discretionary bonus, profit-sharing, retirement and other employee benefit plans and participation
in any fringe benefits shall not reduce the salary payable to the Officer under this Paragraph. In
the event of a Change in Control (as defined in Paragraph&nbsp;10), the Officer&#146;s rate of salary shall
be increased not less than five percent annually during the term of this Agreement. Any payments
made under this Agreement shall be subject to such deductions as are required by law or regulation
or as may be agreed to by the Bank and the Officer.
</DIV>

<DIV align="JUSTIFY" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.&nbsp;<U><B>Discretionary Bonuses</B></U>. During the term of this Agreement, the Officer shall be
entitled to such discretionary bonuses as may be authorized, declared and paid by the Committee to
the Bank&#146;s key management employees. No other compensation provided for in this Agreement shall be
deemed a substitute for the Officer&#146;s right to such discretionary bonuses when and as declared by
the Committee.

compensation, stock options, stock purchases, pension, thrift, profit sharing, group life
insurance, education, or other retirement or employee benefits that the Bank has adopted, or may,

subject to the eligibility rules of such plans.

<DIV align="JUSTIFY" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f)&nbsp;Following a Termination Event which gives rise to Officer&#146;s rights hereunder, the Officer
shall have twelve (12)&nbsp;months from the date of occurrence of the Termination Event to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to this Paragraph&nbsp;10. Any such termination shall be deemed to have
occurred only upon delivery to the Bank (or to any successor corporation) of written notice of
termination which describes the Change in Control and the Termination Event. If Officer does not
so terminate this Agreement within such twelve-month period, he shall thereafter have no further
rights hereunder with respect to that Termination Event, but shall retain rights, if any, hereunder
with respect to any other Termination Event as to which such period has not expired.
</DIV>

<DIV align="JUSTIFY" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(g)&nbsp;In the event any dispute shall arise between the Officer and the Bank as to the terms or
interpretation of this Agreement, including this Paragraph&nbsp;10, whether instituted by formal legal
proceedings or otherwise, including any action taken by the Officer to enforce the terms of this
Paragraph&nbsp;10 or in defending against any action taken by the Bank, the Bank shall reimburse the
Officer for all costs and expenses, proceedings or actions, in the event the Officer prevails in
any such action.

binding upon any corporate or other successor of the Bank which shall acquire, directly or
indirectly, by conversion, merger, purchase or otherwise, all or substantially all of the assets of
the Bank.
</DIV>

<DIV align="JUSTIFY" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;Since the Bank is contracting for the unique and personal skills of the Officer, the
Officer shall be precluded from assigning or delegating his rights or duties hereunder without
first obtaining the written consent of the Bank.
</DIV>

<DIV align="JUSTIFY" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12.&nbsp;<U><B>Modification; Wavier; Amendments</B></U>. This Agreement represents, constitutes, and
incorporates the entire, exclusive, and complete understanding of the parties hereto and replaces
all previous agreements. This Agreement replaces the &#147;probationary period&#148; employment letter
between the Officer and the Bank dated as of his employment, which established the non-competition
covenant in consideration of Officer&#146;s employment by the Bank. The Officer, by execution of this
Agreement, acknowledges that by acceptance of the terms of this Agreement, the Officer agrees not
to dispute, and waives any argument as to, the adequacy of the consideration for the
non-competition and other covenants in this Agreement. No provision of this Agreement may be
modified, waived or discharged unless such waiver, modification or discharge is agreed to in
writing, signed by the Officer and on behalf of the Bank by such officer as may be specifically
designated by the Board of Directors. No waiver by either party hereto, at any time, of any breach
by the other party hereto of, or compliance with, any condition or provision of this Agreement to
be performed by such other party shall be deemed a waiver of similar or dissimilar provisions or
conditions at the same or at any prior or subsequent time. No amendment or addition to this
Agreement shall be binding unless in writing and signed by both parties, except as herein otherwise
provided.
</DIV>

<DIV align="JUSTIFY" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13.&nbsp;<U><B>Applicable Law</B></U>. This Agreement shall be governed in all respects whether as to
validity, construction, capacity, performance or otherwise, by the laws of North Carolina, except
to the extent that federal law shall be deemed to apply.
</DIV>

<DIV align="JUSTIFY" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14.&nbsp;<U><B>Severability</B></U>. The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed severable and the
invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
the other provisions hereof.
