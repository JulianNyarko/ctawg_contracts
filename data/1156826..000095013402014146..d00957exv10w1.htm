<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;Notwithstanding any other provision of the Declaration of Trust, as
supplemented hereby, if the ceiling provisions set forth in Section&nbsp;16(a)
hereof causes income which would otherwise be allocated to Edgewater or
Emerging Growth to be allocated to the holder of Class&nbsp;A-2 Units, the cash
otherwise distributable to Edgewater or Emerging Growth in respect of such
reallocated income shall be reduced by a amount equal to such reallocated
income. If, by application of this Section&nbsp;16, either Edgewater or Emerging
Growth is distributed less cash for any period than the amount to which it
would otherwise be entitled, an amount equal to such shortfall shall be made up
by distributing cash to such holder, on the first Distribution Payment Date
following each period for which income is allocated to such holder pursuant to
the penultimate sentence of the immediately preceding subsection, in an amount
equal to the income so allocated. Solely for purposes of this Section&nbsp;16(b),
income shall be deemed to be allocated immediately prior to each Distribution
Payment Date.
