<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Change in Control Agreement (the &#147;Agreement&#148;) is entered into as of
the _____ day of _____________, 2002, by and between Archstone-Smith Operating
Trust, a Maryland real estate investment trust (the &#147;Operating Trust&#148;),
Archstone-Smith Trust, a Maryland real estate investment trust (&#147;ASN&#148;)
(Operating Trust and ASN are sometimes hereinafter collectively referred to as
the &#147;Company&#148;) and <B>&#091;insert name&#093; </B>(the &#147;Executive&#148;) under the following
circumstances:
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company wishes to assure itself of the continuity of the
Executive&#146;s services in the event of an actual change in control of the
Company;
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company and the Executive accordingly desire to enter into this
Agreement on the terms and conditions set forth below.
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the promises and mutual covenants set
forth herein and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and
sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, it is hereby agreed by and between
the parties as follows:
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Term of Agreement</B>. The term of this Agreement (the &#147;Term&#148;) shall
commence on the date hereof and shall continue through December&nbsp;31, 2002;
provided, however, that on such date and on each December&nbsp;31 thereafter, the
Term of this Agreement shall automatically be extended for one additional year
unless, not later than sixty (60)&nbsp;days prior to December&nbsp;31 either party shall
have given notice that such party does not wish to extend the Term; and
provided, further, that if a Change in Control (as defined in Paragraph&nbsp;3
below) shall have occurred during the original or any extended Term of this
Agreement, the Term of this Agreement shall continue for a period of
&#091;thirty-six if Tier 1; twenty-four if Tier 2; twelve if Tier 3&#093; calendar months
beyond the calendar month in which such Change in Control occurs.
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Employment After Change in Control</B>. If the Executive is in the employ
of the Company on the date of a Change in Control, the Company hereby agrees to
continue Executive in its employ for the period commencing on the date of the
Change in Control and ending on the last day of the Term of this Agreement (the
&#147;Employment Period&#148;). During the Employment Period, the Executive shall hold
such position with the Company and exercise such authority and perform such
duties as are substantially commensurate with the Executive&#146;s position,
authority and duties immediately prior to the Change in Control. The Executive
agrees that, during the Employment Period, the Executive shall devote full
business time and attention to the Executive&#146;s duties and perform such duties
faithfully and efficiently; provided, however, that nothing in this Agreement
shall prevent the Executive from voluntarily resigning from employment upon 30
days&#146; written notice to the Company under circumstances which do not constitute
a Termination (as defined in Paragraph&nbsp;5 below).
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Change in Control</B>. For purposes of this Agreement, &#147;Change in Control&#148;
means the occurrence of any of the following:
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the shareholders of ASN approve a definitive agreement to merge ASN or
the Operating Trust into or consolidate ASN or the Operating Trust with another
entity, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of the assets of
the Operating Trust, or adopt a plan of liquidation; provided that if the
merger, consolidation, sale of assets or liquidation is not consummated for any
reason, then no Change in Control shall be deemed to have occurred; and
provided further, that if the merger, consolidation, sale of assets or
liquidation is consummated, then a Change in Control shall be deemed to have
occurred as of the date of the shareholder approval of such transaction. A
Change in Control shall not be deemed to have occurred, however, by reason of a
transaction (or a substantially concurrent or otherwise related series of
transactions) (a &#147;Transaction&#148;) upon the completion of which <B>&#091;75% for
corporate/ 50% for division personnel&#093; </B>or more of the beneficial ownership of
the voting power of ASN, the surviving entity or entity directly or indirectly
controlling ASN or the surviving entity, as the case may be, is held by the
same persons (although not necessarily in the same proportion) as held the
&#147;beneficial ownership&#148; (as defined in Rule&nbsp;13(d)(3) under the Exchange Act) of
the voting power of ASN immediately prior to the Transaction (except that upon
the completion thereof, employees or employee benefit plans of ASN may be a new
holder of such beneficial ownership); provided, however, that in the event that
the shareholders of ASN immediately prior to the consummation of a Transaction
beneficially own (not giving effect to any shares beneficially owned by such
persons in any party to the Transaction other than ASN) less than <B>&#091;75% for
corporate/ 50% for division personnel&#093; </B>of the voting power of ASN, the
surviving entity or entity directly or indirectly controlling ASN or the
surviving corporation, as the case may be, immediately after the consummation
of the Transaction, then a Change in Control shall be deemed to have occurred.
A transaction with an &#147;Affiliate&#148; of ASN (as defined in the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended (the &#147;Exchange Act&#148;)) shall not be treated as a Change
in Control; or,

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">Executive for any of the reasons noted in subparagraphs a, b, c, or d of this
Paragraph&nbsp;5, the date of the Executive&#146;s Termination shall be the resignation

engaging by the Executive in conduct which is demonstrably injurious to the
Company, monetarily or otherwise, or (iii)&nbsp;the engaging by the Executive in

Agreement, no act, or failure to act, on the Executive&#146;s part shall be deemed
&#147;willful&#148; unless done, or omitted to be done, by the Executive not in good
faith and without reasonable belief that such action was in the best interest
of ASN.

to receive any benefits that may be otherwise payable to or on behalf of the
Executive pursuant to the terms of any severance pay arrangement of the Company
(or any Affiliate of the Company), including any arrangement of the Company (or
any Affiliate of the Company) providing benefits upon involuntary termination
of employment.

&#147;rabbi trust&#148; and transfer to such &#147;rabbi trust&#148; an amount of cash sufficient
to provide all benefits accrued by the Executive under all deferred

only in the event of such Termination): any election by the Executive as to the
form of payment of benefits under any deferred compensation plan
that is made within thirty (30)&nbsp;days after the date of Change in Control,
and before the Executive is entitled to such benefits, will be given effect,
whether or not such election was on file at least twelve (12)&nbsp;months prior to
such Termination.
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Share Awards</B>. In the event of a Termination as set forth in Paragraph
5 above, the restrictions on any outstanding share awards (including
nonqualified options, incentive share options, matching share options,
purchased shares, restricted share units and performance units) granted to
Executive under any incentive plan or arrangement shall lapse and such share
awards shall become 100% vested, and all other awards granted to Executive
shall become immediately exercisable and shall become 100% vested. The
expiration date of Executive&#146;s share options shall be the three-month
anniversary of the date of the Termination as set forth in Paragraph&nbsp;5 above.
The provisions of this Paragraph&nbsp;8 shall be controlling over any inconsistent
provisions set forth in any share award agreement.
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Make-Whole Payments</B>. Subject to the following three sentences, if any
payment or benefit to which the Executive is entitled, whether under this
Agreement or otherwise, in connection with a Change in Control or the
Executive&#146;s termination of employment (a &#147;Payment&#148;) is subject to any tax under
section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the &#147;Code&#148;), or
any similar federal or state law (an &#147;Excise Tax&#148;), the Company shall pay to
the Executive an additional amount (the &#147;Make Whole-Amount&#148;) which is equal to
(i)&nbsp;the amount of the Excise Tax, plus (ii)&nbsp;the aggregate amount of any
interest, penalties, fines or additions to any tax that are imposed in
connection with such Excise Tax, plus (iii)&nbsp;all income, excise and other
applicable taxes imposed on the Executive under the laws of any Federal, state
or local government or taxing authority by reason of the payments required
under clause (i)&nbsp;and clause (ii)&nbsp;and this clause (iii). Such Make Whole-Amount
will not be paid to the Executive if the Payment is less than ten (10)&nbsp;percent
above the maximum amount that may be paid without incurring Excise Tax. In the
event that the Payment is greater than the maximum amount that may be paid
without incurring Excise Tax, but less than 10&nbsp;percent greater than the maximum
amount, then the Payment shall be capped at the maximum amount that may be paid
without incurring Excise Tax. In such event, the cash severance payments
provided in Paragraph&nbsp;6 above and/or the outplacement services provided in
Paragraph&nbsp;10 below, at the Executive&#146;s election, shall be reduced to a level
that results in the total Payment being equal to the maximum amount that may be
paid without incurring Excise Tax.

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For purposes of determining the Make-Whole Amount, the Executive shall
be deemed to be taxed at the highest marginal rate under all applicable local,
state, federal and foreign income tax laws for the year in which the Make-Whole
Amount is paid. The Make-Whole Amount payable with respect to an Excise Tax
shall be paid by the Company coincident with the Payment with respect to which
such Excise Tax relates.
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All calculations under this Paragraph&nbsp;9 shall be made initially by the
Company and the Company shall provide prompt written notice thereof to the
Executive to enable the Executive to timely file all applicable tax returns.
Upon request of the Executive, the Company shall provide the Executive with
sufficient tax and compensation data to enable the Executive or his tax advisor
to independently make the calculations described in subparagraph (a)&nbsp;above and
the Company shall reimburse the Executive for reasonable fees and expenses
incurred for any such verification.
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Executive gives written notice to the Company of any objection
to the results of the Company&#146;s calculations within sixty (60)&nbsp;days of the
Executive&#146;s receipt of written notice thereof, the dispute shall be referred
for determination to tax counsel selected by the independent auditors of the
Company (&#147;Tax Counsel&#148;). The Company shall pay all reasonable fees and
expenses of such Tax Counsel. Pending such determination by Tax Counsel, the
Company shall pay the Executive the Make-Whole Amount as determined by the
Company in good faith. The Company shall pay the Executive any additional
amount determined by Tax Counsel to be due under this Paragraph&nbsp;9 (together
with interest thereon at a rate equal to 120% of the Federal short-term rate
compounded daily determined under section 1274(d) of the Code) promptly after
such determination.

all parties unless the Internal Revenue Service, a court of competent
jurisdiction, or such other duly empowered governmental body or agency (a &#147;Tax

Excise Tax with respect to any Payment than the amount determined by Tax

claim to be contested, it shall promptly (but in no event more than thirty (30)

Authority may specify for responding to such claim) request the Executive to
contest the claim. The Executive shall not make any payment of any tax which
is subject of the claim before the Executive has given the notice or during the
thirty (30)&nbsp;day period thereafter unless the Executive receives written
instructions from the Company to make such payment together with an advance of
funds sufficient to make the requested payment plus any amounts payable under
this Paragraph&nbsp;9 determined as if such advance were an Excise Tax, in which
case the Executive will act promptly in accordance with such instructions.

either paying the tax claimed and suing for a refund in the appropriate court
or contesting the claim in the United States Tax Court or other appropriate
court, as directed by the Company; provided, however, that any request by the
Company for the Executive to pay the tax shall be accompanied by an advance
from the Company to the Executive of funds sufficient to make the requested
payment plus any amounts payable under this Paragraph&nbsp;9 determined as if such
advance were an Excise Tax. If directed by the Company in writing, the
Executive will take all action necessary to compromise or settle the claim, but
in no event will the Executive compromise or settle the claim or cease to
contest the claim without the written consent of the Company; provided,
however, that the Executive may take any such action if the Executive waives in
writing his right to a payment under this Paragraph&nbsp;9 for any amounts payable
in connection with such claim. The Executive agrees to cooperate in good faith
with the Company in contesting the claim and to comply with any reasonable
request from the Company concerning the contest of the claim, including the
pursuit of administrative remedies, the appropriate forum for any judicial
proceedings, and the legal basis for contesting the claim. Upon request of the
Company, the Executive shall take appropriate appeals of any judgment or
decision that would require the Company to make a payment under this Paragraph
9. Provided that the Executive is in compliance with the provisions of this
paragraph, the Company shall be liable for and indemnify the Executive against
any loss in connection with, and all costs and expenses, including attorneys&#146;
fees, which may be incurred as a result of, contesting the claim, and shall
provide to the Executive, within ten (10)&nbsp;days after each written request
therefor by the Executive, cash advances or reimbursement for all such costs
and expenses actually incurred or reasonably expected to be incurred by the
Executive as a result of contesting the claim.

is owed, then the Company shall pay an additional Make-Whole Amount to the
Executive in a manner consistent with this Paragraph&nbsp;9 with respect to any
additional Excise Tax and any assessed interest, fines, or penalties. If any
Excise Tax as calculated by the Company or Tax Counsel, as the case may be, is
finally determined by a Tax Authority to exceed the amount required to be paid
under applicable law, then the Executive shall repay such excess to the Company
within thirty (30)&nbsp;days of such determination; provided that such repayment
shall be reduced by the amount of any taxes paid by the Executive on such
excess which is not offset by the tax benefit attributable to the repayment.

above, any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement or
the breach thereof shall be settled by arbitration in Denver, Colorado, in
accordance with the laws of the State of Colorado, by three arbitrators
appointed by the parties. If the parties cannot agree within 30&nbsp;days on the
appointment of the arbitrators, one shall be appointed by the Company and one
by the Executive, and the third shall be appointed by the first two
arbitrators. If the first two arbitrators cannot agree on the appointment of a

by the Chief Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit.

Termination occurs during the Employment Period, then, subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, during the period beginning on the date of
delivery of a notice of Termination, and ending on the date of Termination, the
Executive shall continue to perform the duties as an employee, and shall also
perform such services for the Company as are necessary and appropriate for a
smooth transition to the Executive&#146;s successor, if any. Notwithstanding the
foregoing provisions of this paragraph, the Company may suspend the Executive
from performing duties as an employee following the delivery of a notice of
Termination providing for the Executive&#146;s resignation, or delivery by the
Company of a notice of Termination providing for the Executive&#146;s termination of
employment for any reason; provided, however, that during the period of
suspension (which shall end on the Executive&#146;s date of Termination), the

Entity in the prosecution of any claims that may be made by the Company or any
Company-Related Entity, to the extent that such claims may relate to services
performed by the Executive for the Company or any such Company-Related Entity.
The Executive agrees to promptly inform the Company if the Executive becomes
aware of any lawsuits involving such claims that may be filed against the
Company or any Company-Related Entity. The Company agrees to provide legal
counsel to the Executive in connection with such assistance (to the extent
legally permitted), and to reimburse the Executive for all of the Executive&#146;s
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses associated with such assistance, including
travel expenses. The Company agrees to provide reasonable compensation to the
Executive for such assistance. The Executive also agrees to promptly inform
the Company if asked to assist in any investigation of the Company or any
Company-Related Entity (or their actions) that may relate to services
performed by the Executive for the Company or any Company-Related Entity,
regardless of whether a lawsuit has then been filed against the Company or any
Company-Related Entity with respect to such investigation.

anticipation of payment, either by voluntary or involuntary acts, or by
operation of law. Nothing in this paragraph shall limit the Executive&#146;s rights
or powers to dispose of his or her property by will, or limit any rights or
powers which his or her executor or administrator would otherwise have. This
Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Executive&#146;s
personal or legal representatives, executors, administrators, successors,
heirs, distributees, devisees, and legatees. If the Executive should die while
any amount is still payable to the Executive hereunder had the Executive

meaning either party may terminate the employment relationship at any time,
with or without Cause, subject in the event of a Termination, as defined in

(ii)&nbsp;the Company&#146;s obligations to provide severance payments as required by

This Agreement shall not be construed to require the Company to provide any
compensation, benefits, or other rights under Paragraph&nbsp;6 if the Executive&#146;s
employment is terminated outside the Employment Period. Nothing in this
Agreement shall be construed to require the Company or any other person to take
steps or not take steps (including, without limitation, the giving or
withholding of consents) that would result in a Change in Control.

whom enforcement or any such modification or amendment is sought. Either party
hereto may, by an instrument in writing, waive compliance by the other party
with any term or provision of this Agreement on the part of such other party
hereto to be performed or complied with. The waiver by any party hereto of a
