SIZE="2">&#147;4.3 <U>Adjustment in Authorized Shares</U>. In the event of any corporate event or transaction (including a change in the Shares or the capitalization of the Company), such as a reclassification, recapitalization, merger,
consolidation, reorganization (whether or not such reorganization comes within the definition of such term in Section&nbsp;368 of the Code), issuance of warrants or rights, dividend or other distribution (whether in the form of cash, stock or other
property), stock split or reverse stock split, spin-off, split-up, combination or exchange of shares, repurchase of shares, or other like change in corporate structure, partial or complete liquidation of the Company or distribution (other than
normal cash dividends) to shareholders of the Company, or any similar corporate event or transaction, the Committee, in order to prevent dilution or enlargement of Participants&#146; rights under the Plan, shall substitute or adjust, as applicable,
the number, class and kind of securities which may be delivered under Section&nbsp;4.1; the number, class and kind, and/or price (such as the Option Price of Options or the Grant Price of SARs) of securities subject to outstanding Awards; the Award
limits set forth in Section&nbsp;4.2; and other value determinations applicable to outstanding Awards; <U>provided, however</U> that the number of Shares subject to any Award shall always be a whole number. The Committee shall also make appropriate
adjustments and modifications in the terms of any outstanding Awards to reflect or related to any such events, adjustments, substitutions or changes, including modifications of performance goals and changes in the length of Performance Periods,
subject to the requirements of Article XII in the case of Awards intended to qualify as Performance-Based Compensation. Any adjustment, substitution or change pursuant to this Section&nbsp;4.3 made with respect to an Award intended to be an
Incentive Stock Option shall be made only to the extent consistent with such intent, unless the Committee determines otherwise, and any such adjustment that is made with respect to an Award that provides for Performance-Based Compensation shall be
made consistent with the intent that such Award qualify for the performance-based compensation exception under Section&nbsp;162(m) of the Code. The Committee shall not make any adjustment pursuant to this Section&nbsp;4.3 that would cause an Award
that is otherwise exempt from Code Section&nbsp;409A to become subject to Code Section&nbsp;409A, or that would cause an Award that is subject to Code Section&nbsp;409A to fail to satisfy the requirements of Code Section&nbsp;409A. All
determinations of the Committee as to adjustments or changes under this Section&nbsp;4.3 shall be conclusive and binding on the Participants.&#148; </FONT></P>
