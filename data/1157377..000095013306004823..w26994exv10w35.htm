property of like kind, and SunTrust shall not be under any obligation to take any action
with respect to any of the Collateral or to preserve rights against prior parties. The

SunTrust to provide Owner with investment advice. SunTrust shall have no duty to ascertain
or take any action with respect to calls, conversions, exchanges, maturities, tenders or
other matters concerning any Collateral, whether or not SunTrust has or is deemed to have
knowledge of such matters, or as to the taking of any necessary steps to preserve any rights

agent and attorney-in-fact for the purpose of carrying out the provisions of this Agreement
and taking any action or executing any instrument that SunTrust considers necessary or
convenient for such purpose, including the power to endorse and deliver checks, notes and
other instruments for the payment of money in the name of and on behalf of Owner, to endorse
and deliver in the name of and on behalf of Owner, securities certificates and file in the
name of and on behalf of Owner financing statements as deemed appropriate by SunTrust and or
such for other forms as may be required by the United States Securities and Exchange
Commission. This appointment is coupled with an interest and is irrevocable and will not be
affected by the bankruptcy of Owner nor by the lapse of time. If Owner fails to perform any
act required by this Agreement, SunTrust may perform such act in the name of and on behalf
of Owner and at Owner&#146;s expense which shall be chargeable to Owner under Section&nbsp;5 below.
Owner hereby consents and agrees that the issuers of or obligors of the Collateral or any
registrar or transfer agent or trustee for any of the Collateral shall be entitled to accept
the provisions as conclusive evidence of the rights of SunTrust to effect any transfer,
notwithstanding any other notice or direction to the contrary given by Owner, or any other
person, at any time; <U>provided</U> that, except with respect to the filing of financing
statements or other similar forms the purpose of which is to perfect SunTrust&#146;s security
interest in the Collateral, SunTrust shall have no rights under this Section&nbsp;4.3 unless an
Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 6%"><B>4.4 Impact of Regulations. </B>Owner acknowledges that compliance with the Securities Act of
1933 and the rules and regulations thereunder and any relevant state securities laws and
other applicable laws may impose limitations on the right of SunTrust to sell or otherwise
dispose of securities included in the Collateral. For this reason, Owner authorizes SunTrust
to sell any securities included in the Collateral in such manner and to such persons as
would, in the judgment of SunTrust, help to ensure that the transfer of such securities will
be given prompt and effective approval by any relevant regulatory authorities and will not
require any of the securities to be registered or qualified under any applicable securities
laws. Owner understands that a sale under the foregoing circumstances may yield a
substantially lower price for such Collateral than would otherwise be obtainable if the same
were registered and sold in the open market, and Owner shall not attempt to hold SunTrust
responsible for selling any of the Collateral at an inadequate price

qualified appraiser or investment banker as to the commercially reasonable price obtainable
on the sale but shall not be obligated to obtain such advice or opinion. Owner assigns to
SunTrust any registration rights or similar rights Owner may have from time to time with
