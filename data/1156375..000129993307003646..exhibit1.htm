do so by a court of competent jurisdiction, CBOT Holdings shall not make any payment
with respect to, or offer to settle or settle, any such demands.&#148;


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%"><I>4.&nbsp;Amendment to Section&nbsp;3.23</I>. Section&nbsp;3.23 of the Agreement is hereby amended by deleting the

Section&nbsp;6.19 as follows:



<P align="left" style="margin-left:8%; font-size: 12pt">&#147;Section&nbsp;6.19. <I>Conditional Special Dividend</I>. CBOT Holdings agrees to declare, and
CBOT Holdings shall declare, at such time as determined by the CBOT Holdings Board
of Directors (or a committee thereof), but in all events before the CBOT Holdings
Stockholders Meeting, a one-time, special cash dividend to holders of record
(collectively, the &#147;<U>Relevant Record Holders</U>&#148;) of CBOT Holdings Class&nbsp;A
Common Stock in the amount of $9.14 per share of CBOT Holdings Class&nbsp;A Common Stock
(the &#147;<U>Conditional Special Dividend</U>&#148;) held by Relevant Record Holders on the

such holder on the Conditional Dividend Record Date, in addition to any Merger
Consideration that such Relevant Record Holder shall be entitled to receive in
respect of each such share of CBOT Holdings Class&nbsp;A Common Stock under this
Agreement. For the sake of clarity, nothing in this <U>Section&nbsp;6.19</U> and no
action taken pursuant to this <U>Section&nbsp;6.19</U>, shall give rise to any
adjustment to the Exchange Ratio.&#148;


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%"><I>8.&nbsp;Amendment to Section&nbsp;9.8. </I>Section&nbsp;9.8 of the Agreement is hereby amended to add the
following sentence at the end of such Section:



<P align="left" style="margin-left:8%; font-size: 12pt">&#147;If, in the opinion of either counsel to CME Holdings or counsel to CBOT Holdings,
it is highly likely that the Merger could fail to qualify as a tax free
reorganization described in Section&nbsp;368 of the Code due to the exercise of appraisal
rights or otherwise, then the parties hereto agree to negotiate in good faith to
restructure the Merger in order that it shall otherwise qualify as a transaction
that is in whole or in part tax-free under the Code, including as a Section&nbsp;351
exchange under the Code; provided, that in no way shall such restructuring result in
any change in the Exchange Ratio, the Merger Consideration or in the economics or
other material terms of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to CME
Holdings or its stockholders, or CBOT Holdings, CBOT or their respective
stockholders and members.&#148;

attached to the Agreement as <U>Exhibit&nbsp;B</U> is hereby replaced in its entirety with the form of

Amendment except as set forth in Sections&nbsp;1 through 11 of this Amendment. The provisions of the
Agreement that have not been amended hereby shall remain in full force and effect. The provisions

granted to and imposed on the shares of Preferred Stock of the corporation shall be as set forth
below in this Division A.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">Shares of Preferred Stock may be issued in one or more series at such time or times, and for
such consideration or considerations, as the board of directors shall determine. The board of
directors is hereby authorized to fix, state and establish, in the resolution or resolutions
providing for the issuance of any wholly unissued series of Preferred Stock, the relative powers,
rights, designations, preferences, qualifications, limitations and restrictions of such series in
relation to any other series of Preferred Stock at the time outstanding. The board of directors is
also expressly authorized to fix the number of shares of each such series, but not below the number
of shares thereof then outstanding. The authority of the board of directors with respect to each
series of Preferred Stock shall include (without limitation) the determination of the following:


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(a)&nbsp;the dividend rate on the shares of such series, whether dividends shall be cumulative,
and, if so, from which date or dates, and the rights of priority, if any, with respect to the
payment of dividends on the shares of such series relative to other series of Preferred Stock or
classes of stock;


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(b)&nbsp;whether the shares of such series shall have voting rights (other than the voting rights
provided by law) and, if so, the terms and extent of such voting rights;


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(c)&nbsp;whether the shares of such series shall have conversion privileges, and, if so, the terms
and conditions of such conversion, including provision for adjustment of the conversion rate upon
the occurrence of such events as the board of directors may prescribe;


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(d)&nbsp;whether the shares of such series shall be subject to redemption by the corporation or at
the request of the holder(s) thereof, and, if so, the terms and conditions of any such redemption;


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(e)&nbsp;the rights of the shares of such series in the event of voluntary or involuntary
liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the corporation, and the rights of priority, if any, with
respect to the distribution of assets on the shares of such series relative to other series of
Preferred Stock or classes of stock; and


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(f)&nbsp;any other preferences, privileges and powers, and relative, participating, optional or
other special rights, and qualifications, limitations or restrictions of such series, as the board
of directors may deem advisable and as shall not be inconsistent with the provisions of this
Certificate of Incorporation, as the same may be amended from time to time.


<P align="center" style="font-size: 12pt">* * * *



<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">Pursuant to the above stated authority, the board of directors has designated the following
series of Preferred Stock:


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">SECTION 2. DESIGNATION AND AMOUNT.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">The shares of such series shall be designated as &#147;<U>Series&nbsp;A Junior Participating Preferred
Stock</U>&#148; and the number of shares constituting such series shall be 140,000.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">SECTION 3. DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(a)&nbsp;The holders of shares of Series&nbsp;A Junior Participating Preferred Stock shall be entitled
to receive, when, as and if declared by the board of directors out of funds legally available for
the purpose, quarterly dividends payable in cash on the last day of March, June, September and
December in each year (each such date being referred to herein as a &#147;<U>Quarterly Dividend Payment
Date</U>&#148;), commencing on the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date after the first issuance of a
share or fraction of a share of Series&nbsp;A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, in an amount per
share (rounded to the nearest cent) equal to the greater of (x) $.01 or (y)&nbsp;subject to the
provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth, 1,000 times the aggregate per share amount of all
cash dividends, and 1,000 times the aggregate per share amount (payable in kind) of all non-cash
dividends or other distributions other than a dividend payable in shares of Class&nbsp;A Common Stock or
a subdivision of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (by reclassification or otherwise),
declared on the Class&nbsp;A Common Stock, since the immediately preceding Quarterly Dividend Payment
Date, or, with respect to the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, since the first issuance of
any share or fraction of a share of Series&nbsp;A Junior Participating Preferred Stock. In the event
the corporation shall at any time after the date of consummation of the merger of CME Merger
Subsidiary Inc. with and into the Exchange (as defined below) (the &#147;<U>Rights Declaration
Date</U>&#148;) (i)&nbsp;declare any dividend on Class&nbsp;A Common Stock payable in shares of Class&nbsp;A Common
Stock, (ii)&nbsp;subdivide the outstanding Class&nbsp;A Common Stock, or (iii)&nbsp;combine the outstanding Class
A Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, then in each such case the amount to which holders
of shares of Series&nbsp;A Junior Participating Preferred Stock were entitled immediately prior to such
event under clause (y)&nbsp;of the preceding sentence shall be adjusted by multiplying such amount by a
fraction the numerator of which is the number of shares of Class&nbsp;A Common Stock outstanding
immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Class&nbsp;A Common
Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(b)&nbsp;The corporation shall declare a dividend or distribution on the Series&nbsp;A Junior
Participating Preferred Stock as provided in Paragraph (a)&nbsp;above immediately after it declares a
dividend or distribution on the Class&nbsp;A Common Stock (other than a dividend payable in shares of
Class&nbsp;A Common Stock); provided that, in the event no dividend or distribution shall have been
declared on the Class&nbsp;A Common Stock during the period between any Quarterly Dividend Payment Date
and the next subsequent Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, a dividend of $.01 per share on the Series
A Junior Participating Preferred Stock shall nevertheless be payable on such subsequent Quarterly
Dividend Payment Date.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(c)&nbsp;Dividends shall begin to accrue and be cumulative on outstanding shares of Series&nbsp;A Junior
Participating Preferred Stock from the Quarterly Dividend Payment Date next preceding the date of
issue of such shares of Series&nbsp;A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, unless the date of issue of
such shares is prior to the record date for the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, in which
case dividends on such shares shall begin to accrue from the date of issue of such shares, or
unless the date of issue is a Quarterly Dividend Payment Date or is a date after the record date
for the determination of holders of shares of Series&nbsp;A Junior Participating Preferred Stock
entitled to receive a quarterly dividend and before such Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, in either
of which events such dividends shall begin to accrue and be cumulative from such Quarterly Dividend
Payment Date. Accrued but unpaid dividends shall not bear interest. Dividends paid on the shares
of Series&nbsp;A Junior Participating Preferred Stock in an amount less than the total amount of such
dividends at the time accrued and payable on such shares shall be allocated pro rata on a
share-by-share basis among all such shares at the time outstanding. The board of directors may fix
a record date for the determination of holders of shares of Series&nbsp;A Junior Participating Preferred
Stock entitled to receive payment of a dividend or distribution declared thereon, which record date
shall be no more than 30&nbsp;days prior to the date fixed for the payment thereof.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">SECTION 4. VOTING RIGHTS.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">The holders of shares of Series&nbsp;A Junior Participating Preferred Stock shall have the
following voting rights:


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(a)&nbsp;Subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth, each share of Series&nbsp;A
Junior Participating Preferred Stock shall entitle the holder thereof to 1,000 votes on all matters
submitted to a vote of the shareholders of the corporation. In the event the corporation shall at
any time after the Rights Declaration Date (i)&nbsp;declare any dividend on Class&nbsp;A Common Stock payable
in shares of Class&nbsp;A Common Stock, (ii)&nbsp;subdivide the outstanding Class&nbsp;A Common Stock, or (iii)
combine the outstanding Class&nbsp;A Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, then in each such
case the number of votes per share to which holders of shares of Series&nbsp;A Junior Participating
Preferred Stock were entitled immediately prior to such event shall be adjusted by multiplying such
number by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of shares of Class&nbsp;A Common Stock
outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of
Class&nbsp;A Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(b)&nbsp;Except as otherwise provided herein or by law, the holders of shares of Series&nbsp;A Junior
Participating Preferred Stock and the holders of shares of Class&nbsp;A Common Stock and Class&nbsp;B Common
Stock shall vote together as one class on all matters submitted to a vote of shareholders of the
corporation.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(c) (i)&nbsp;&nbsp;If at any time dividends on any Series&nbsp;A Junior Participating Preferred Stock
shall be in arrears in an amount equal to six quarterly dividends thereon, the occurrence of
such contingency shall mark the beginning of a period (herein called a &#147;<U>default
period</U>&#148;) which shall extend until such time when all accrued and unpaid dividends for
all previous quarterly dividend periods and for the current quarterly dividend period on all
&nbsp;shares of Series&nbsp;A Junior Participating Preferred Stock then outstanding shall have been
declared and paid or set apart for payment. During each default period, all holders of
Preferred Stock (including holders of the Series&nbsp;A Junior Participating Preferred Stock)
with dividends in arrears in an amount equal to six quarterly dividends thereon, voting as a
class, irrespective of series, shall have the right to elect two directors.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 9%">(ii)&nbsp;During any default period, such voting right of the holders of Series&nbsp;A Junior
Participating Preferred Stock may be exercised initially at a special meeting called
pursuant to Paragraph (c)(iii) of this Section&nbsp;3 or at any annual meeting of shareholders,
and thereafter at annual meetings of shareholders, provided that such voting right shall not
be exercised unless the holders of 10% in number of shares of Preferred Stock outstanding
shall be present in person or by proxy. The absence of a quorum of the holders of Common
Stock shall not affect the exercise by the holders of Preferred Stock of such voting right.
At any meeting at which the holders of Preferred Stock shall exercise such voting right
initially during an existing default period, they shall have the right, voting as a class,
to elect directors to fill such vacancies, if any, in the board of directors as may then
exist up to two directors or, if such right is exercised at an annual meeting, to elect two
directors. If the number which may be so elected at any special meeting does not amount to
the required number, the holders of the Preferred Stock shall have the right to make such
increase in the number of directors as shall be necessary to permit the election by them of
the required number. After the holders of the Preferred Stock shall have exercised their
right to elect directors in any default period and during the continuance of such period,
the number of directors shall not be increased or decreased except by vote of the holders of
Preferred Stock as herein provided or pursuant to the rights of any equity securities
ranking senior to or <U>pari</U> <U>passu</U> with the Series&nbsp;A Junior Participating
Preferred Stock.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 9%">(iii)&nbsp;Unless the holders of Preferred Stock shall, during an existing default period,
have previously exercised their right to elect directors, the board of directors may order,
or any shareholder or shareholders owning in the aggregate not less than 10% of the total
number of shares of Preferred Stock outstanding, irrespective of series, may request, the
calling of a special meeting of the holders of Preferred Stock, which meeting shall
thereupon be called by the Chairman of the Board, the President, any Managing Director or
the Secretary of the corporation. Notice of such meeting and of any annual meeting at which
holders of Preferred Stock are entitled to vote pursuant to this Paragraph (c)(iii) shall be
given to each holder of record of Preferred Stock by mailing a copy of such notice to him or
her at his or her last address as the same appears on the books of the corporation. Such
meeting shall be called for a time not earlier than 20&nbsp;days and not later than 60&nbsp;days after
such order or request or in default of the calling of such meeting within 60&nbsp;days after such
order or request, such meeting may be called on similar notice by any shareholder or
shareholders owning in the aggregate not less than 10% of the total number of shares of
Preferred Stock outstanding. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Paragraph (c)(iii), no
such special meeting shall be called during the period within 60&nbsp;days immediately preceding
the date fixed for the next annual meeting of the shareholders.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 9%">(iv)&nbsp;In any default period, the holders of Common Stock, and other classes of stock of
the corporation if applicable, shall continue to be entitled to elect the whole number of
directors until the holders of Preferred Stock shall have exercised their right to elect two
directors voting as a class, after the exercise of which right (x)&nbsp;the directors so elected
by the holders of Preferred Stock shall continue in office until their successors shall have
been elected by such holders or until the expiration of the default period, and (y)&nbsp;any
vacancy in the board of directors may (except as provided in Paragraph (c)(ii) of this
Section&nbsp;3) be filled by vote of a majority of the remaining directors theretofore elected by
the holders of the class of stock which elected the director whose office shall have become
vacant. References in this Paragraph (c)&nbsp;to directors elected by the holders of a
particular class of stock shall include directors elected by such directors to fill
vacancies as provided in clause (y)&nbsp;of the foregoing sentence.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 9%">(v)&nbsp;Immediately upon the expiration of a default period, (x)&nbsp;the right of the holders
of Preferred Stock as a class to elect directors shall cease, (y)&nbsp;the term of any directors
elected by the holders of Preferred Stock as a class shall terminate, and (z)&nbsp;the number of
directors shall be such number as may be provided for in the certificate of incorporation or
bylaws irrespective of any increase made pursuant to the provisions of Paragraph (c)(ii) of
this Section&nbsp;3 (such number being subject, however, to change thereafter in any manner
provided by law or in the certificate of incorporation or bylaws). Any vacancies in the
board of directors effected by the provisions of clauses (y)&nbsp;and (z)&nbsp;in the preceding
sentence may be filled by a majority of the remaining directors.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(d)&nbsp;Except as set forth herein, holders of Series&nbsp;A Junior Participating Preferred Stock shall
have no special voting rights and their consent shall not be required (except to the extent they
are entitled to vote with holders of Common Stock as set forth herein) for taking any corporate
action.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">SECTION 5. CERTAIN RESTRICTIONS.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(a)&nbsp;Whenever quarterly dividends or other dividends or distributions payable on the Series&nbsp;A
Junior Participating Preferred Stock as provided in Section&nbsp;2 are in arrears, thereafter and until
all accrued and unpaid dividends and distributions, whether or not declared, on shares of Series&nbsp;A
Junior Participating Preferred Stock outstanding shall have been paid in full, the corporation
shall not:



<P align="left" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 13%">(i)&nbsp;declare or pay dividends on, make any other distributions on, or redeem or purchase
or otherwise acquire for consideration any shares of stock ranking junior (either as to
dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) to the Series&nbsp;A Junior
Participating Preferred Stock;



<P align="left" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 13%">(ii)&nbsp;declare or pay dividends on or make any other distributions on any shares of stock
ranking on a parity (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up)
with the Series&nbsp;A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, except dividends paid ratably on the
Series&nbsp;A Junior Participating Preferred Stock and all such parity stock on which dividends
are payable or in arrears in proportion to the total amounts to which the holders of all
such shares are then entitled;



<P align="left" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 13%">(iii)&nbsp;redeem or purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration shares of any stock
ranking on a parity (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up)
with the Series&nbsp;A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, provided that the corporation may at
any time redeem, purchase or otherwise acquire shares of any such parity stock in exchange
for shares of any stock of the corporation ranking junior (either as to dividends or upon
dissolution, liquidation or winding up) to the Series&nbsp;A Junior Participating Preferred
Stock; or



<P align="left" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 13%">(iv)&nbsp;purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration any shares of Series&nbsp;A Junior
Participating Preferred Stock, or any shares of stock ranking on a parity with the Series&nbsp;A
Junior Participating Preferred Stock, except in accordance with a purchase offer made in
writing or by publication (as determined by the board of directors) to all holders of such
&nbsp;shares upon such terms as the board of directors, after consideration of the respective
annual dividend rates and other relative rights and preferences of the respective series and
classes, shall determine in good faith will result in fair and equitable treatment among the
respective series or classes.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(b)&nbsp;The corporation shall not permit any subsidiary of the corporation to purchase or
otherwise acquire for consideration any shares of stock of the corporation unless the corporation
could, under Paragraph (a)&nbsp;of this Section&nbsp;4, purchase or otherwise acquire such shares at such
time and in such manner.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">SECTION 6. REACQUIRED SHARES.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">Any shares of Series&nbsp;A Junior Participating Preferred Stock purchased or otherwise acquired by
the corporation in any manner whatsoever shall be retired and cancelled promptly after the
acquisition thereof. All such shares shall upon their cancellation become authorized but unissued
shares of Preferred Stock and may be reissued as part of a new series of Preferred Stock to be
created by resolution or resolutions of the board of directors, subject to the conditions and
restrictions on issuance set forth herein.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">SECTION 7. LIQUIDATION, DISSOLUTION OR WINDING UP.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(a)&nbsp;Upon any liquidation (voluntary or otherwise), dissolution or winding up of the
corporation, no distribution shall be made to the holders of shares of stock ranking junior (either
as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) to the Series&nbsp;A Junior
Participating Preferred Stock unless, prior thereto, the holders of shares of Series&nbsp;A Junior
Participating Preferred Stock shall have received an amount equal to 1,000 times the Exercise
Price, plus an amount equal to accrued and unpaid dividends and distributions thereon, whether or
not declared, to the date of such payment (the &#147;<U>Series&nbsp;A Liquidation Preference</U>&#148;).
Following the payment of the full amount of the Series&nbsp;A Liquidation Preference, no additional
distributions shall be made to the holders of shares of Series&nbsp;A Junior Participating Preferred
Stock unless, prior thereto, the holders of shares of Common Stock shall have received an amount
per share (the &#147;<U>Common Adjustment</U>&#148;) equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (i)&nbsp;the
Series&nbsp;A Liquidation Preference by (ii)&nbsp;1,000 (as appropriately adjusted as set forth in Paragraph
(c)&nbsp;of this Section&nbsp;6 to reflect such events as stock splits, stock dividends and recapitalizations
with respect to the Common Stock) (such number in clause (ii), the &#147;<U>Adjustment Number</U>&#148;).
Following the payment of the full amount of the Series&nbsp;A Liquidation Preference and the Common
Adjustment in respect of all outstanding shares of Series&nbsp;A Junior Participating Preferred Stock
and Common Stock, respectively, holders of Series&nbsp;A Junior Participating Preferred Stock and
holders of shares of both classes of Common Stock shall receive their ratable and proportionate
share of the remaining assets to be distributed in the ratio of the Adjustment Number to 1 with
respect to such Preferred Stock and Common Stock, on a per share basis, respectively.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(b)&nbsp;In the event, however, that there are not sufficient assets available to permit payment in
full of the Series&nbsp;A Liquidation Preference and the liquidation preferences of all other series of
preferred stock, if any, which rank on a parity with the Series&nbsp;A Junior Participating Preferred
Stock, then such remaining assets shall be distributed ratably to the holders of such parity shares
in proportion to their respective liquidation preferences. In the event, however, that there are
not sufficient assets available to permit payment in full of the Common Adjustment, then such
remaining assets shall be distributed ratably to the holders of both classes of Common Stock.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(c)&nbsp;In the event the corporation shall at any time after the Rights Declaration Date (i)
declare any dividend on Class&nbsp;A Common Stock payable in shares of Class&nbsp;A Common Stock, (ii)
subdivide the outstanding Class&nbsp;A Common Stock, or (iii)&nbsp;combine the outstanding Class&nbsp;A Common
Stock into a smaller number of shares, then in each such case the Adjustment Number in effect
immediately prior to such event shall be adjusted by multiplying such Adjustment Number by a
fraction the numerator of which is the number of shares of Class&nbsp;A Common Stock outstanding
immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Class&nbsp;A Common
Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">SECTION 8. CONSOLIDATION, MERGER, ETC.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">In case the corporation shall enter into any consolidation, merger, combination or other
transaction in which the shares of Class&nbsp;A Common Stock are exchanged for or changed into other
stock or securities, cash and/or any other property, then in any such case the shares of Series&nbsp;A
Junior Participating Preferred Stock shall at the same time be similarly exchanged or changed in an
amount per share (subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth) equal to 1,000
times the aggregate amount of stock, securities, cash and/or any other property (payable in kind),
as the case may be, into which or for which each share of Class&nbsp;A Common Stock is changed or
exchanged. In the event the corporation shall at any time after the Rights Declaration Date (i)
declare any dividend on Class&nbsp;A Common Stock payable in shares of Class&nbsp;A Common Stock, (ii)
subdivide the outstanding Class&nbsp;A Common Stock, or (iii)&nbsp;combine the outstanding Class&nbsp;A Common
Stock into a smaller number of shares, then in each such case the amount set forth in the preceding
sentence with respect to the exchange or change of shares of Series&nbsp;A Junior Participating
Preferred Stock shall be adjusted by multiplying such amount by a fraction the numerator of which
is the number of shares of Class&nbsp;A Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the
denominator of which is the number of shares of Class&nbsp;A Common Stock that were outstanding
immediately prior to such event.

Junior Participating Preferred Stock so as to affect them adversely without the affirmative vote of
the holders of a majority or more of the outstanding shares of Series&nbsp;A Junior Participating
Preferred Stock, voting separately as a class.

<P align="center" style="font-size: 11pt">Shareholders&#146; Meetings



<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt; text-indent: 4%">Section&nbsp;1.1 Annual Meetings. (a)&nbsp;The annual meetings of shareholders shall be held on such
date, at such time and at such place, either within or without the state of Delaware, as shall be
designated from time to time by the Board of Directors and stated in the notice of the meeting.
Subject to paragraph (b)&nbsp;of this Section&nbsp;1.1, any other proper business may be transacted at an
annual meeting.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt; text-indent: 12%">(a)&nbsp;At the annual meetings the shareholders shall elect the Board of Directors, and transact
such other business as may properly be brought before the meeting. For such business to be
properly brought before the meeting, it must be: (i)&nbsp;authorized by the Board of Directors and
specified in the notice, or a supplemental notice, of the meeting, (ii)&nbsp;otherwise brought before
the meeting by or at the direction of the Board of Directors or the chairman of the meeting, or
(iii)&nbsp;otherwise properly brought before the meeting by a shareholder. For business to be properly
brought before an annual meeting by a shareholder, the shareholder must have given written notice
thereof to the Secretary, delivered or mailed to and received at the principal executive offices of
the Corporation (x)&nbsp;not less than 90&nbsp;days nor more than 120&nbsp;days prior to the meeting, or (y)&nbsp;if
less than 100&nbsp;days notice of the meeting or prior public disclosure of the date of the meeting is
given or made to shareholders, not later than the close of business on the tenth day following the
day on which the notice of the meeting was mailed or, if earlier, the day on which such public
disclosure was made. A shareholder&#146;s notice to the Secretary shall set forth as to each item of
business the shareholder proposes to bring before the meeting (1)&nbsp;a brief description of such item
and the reasons for conducting such business at the meeting and a representation that the
shareholder intends to appear in person or by proxy at the meeting to introduce the business
specified in the notice, (2)&nbsp;the name and address, as they appear on the Corporation&#146;s records, of
the shareholder proposing such business, (3)&nbsp;the class, and series if any, and number of shares of
stock of the Corporation which are beneficially owned by the shareholder (for purposes of the
regulations under Sections&nbsp;13 and 14 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the
&#147;Exchange Act&#148;)), and (4)&nbsp;any material interest of the shareholder in such business. No business
shall be conducted at any annual meeting except in accordance with the procedures set forth in this
paragraph (b). The chairman of the meeting at which any business is proposed by a shareholder
shall, if the facts warrant, determine and declare to the meeting that such business was not
properly brought before the meeting in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph (b), and,
in such event, the business not properly before the meeting shall not be transacted.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt; text-indent: 4%">Section&nbsp;1.2 Special Meetings. Special meetings of shareholders for any purpose or purposes
may be called at any time only by the Chairman of the Board or by a majority of the total number of
authorized Directors. The business transacted at a special meeting of shareholders shall be limited
to the purpose or purposes for which such meeting is called.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt; text-indent: 4%">Section&nbsp;1.3 Notice of Meetings. A written notice of each annual or special meeting of
shareholders shall be given stating the place, date and time of the meeting, and, in the case of a
special meeting, the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called. Unless otherwise
provided by law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, such notice of meeting shall be
given not less than 10 nor more than 60&nbsp;days before the date of the meeting to each shareholder of
record entitled to vote at such meeting. If mailed, such notice shall be deemed to be given when
deposited in the mail, postage prepaid, directed to the shareholder at such shareholder&#146;s address
as it appears on the records of the Corporation. An affidavit of the Secretary or an Assistant
Secretary or of the transfer agent of the Corporation that the notice has been given shall, in the
absence of fraud, be prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt; text-indent: 4%">Section&nbsp;1.4 Adjournments. Any annual or special meeting of shareholders may be adjourned from
time to time to reconvene at the same or some other place, and notice need not be given of any such
adjourned meeting if the date, time and place thereof are announced at the meeting at which the
adjournment is taken. At the adjourned meeting any business may be transacted which might have
been transacted at the original meeting. If the adjournment is for more than 30&nbsp;days, or if after
the adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned
meeting shall be given to each shareholder of record entitled to vote at the adjourned meeting in
accordance with Section&nbsp;1.3 of these Bylaws.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt; text-indent: 4%">Section&nbsp;1.5 Quorum. Except as otherwise provided by law, the Certificate of Incorporation or
these Bylaws, the presence in person or by proxy of the holders of stock having not less than
one-third of the votes which could be cast by the holders of all outstanding stock entitled to vote
at the meeting shall constitute a quorum at each meeting of shareholders. In the absence of a
quorum, then either (i)&nbsp;the chairman of the meeting or (ii)&nbsp;the shareholders may, by the
affirmative vote of the holders of stock having a majority of the votes which could be cast by all
such holders, adjourn the meeting from time to time in the manner provided in Section&nbsp;1.4 of these
Bylaws until a quorum is present. If a quorum is present when a meeting is convened, the
subsequent withdrawal of shareholders, even though less than a quorum remains, shall not affect the
ability of the remaining shareholders lawfully to transact business.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt; text-indent: 4%">Section&nbsp;1.6 Organization. Meetings of shareholders shall be presided over by the Chairman of
the Board, the Vice Chairman of the Board or the Chief Executive Officer (in that order), or in
their absence, inability or unwillingness, by a chairman designated by the Board of Directors, or
in the absence of such designation, by a chairman chosen at the meeting. The Secretary shall act
as secretary of the meeting, but in his or her absence, the chairman of the meeting may appoint any
person to act as secretary of the meeting. The chairman of any meeting of the shareholders shall
determine the order of business and the procedure at the meeting, including such regulation of the
manner of voting and the conduct of business.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt; text-indent: 4%">Section&nbsp;1.7 Voting. (a)&nbsp;The shareholders entitled to vote at any meeting of shareholders
shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of Section&nbsp;1.10 of these Bylaws, subject to
the provisions of Sections&nbsp;217 and 218 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (relating to voting
rights of fiduciaries, pledgors and joint owners of stock and to voting trusts and other voting
agreements).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt; text-indent: 12%">(a)&nbsp;Except as may be otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation or in these
Bylaws, or as may be otherwise required by applicable law: (i)&nbsp;in all matters other than the
election of Directors, the affirmative vote of the holders of shares representing a majority of the
votes present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote on the subject
matter shall be the act of the shareholders; (ii)&nbsp;each Director shall be elected by a plurality of
the votes of the shares present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to
vote on the election of such Director; and (iii)&nbsp;where a separate vote by a class or series is
required, other than with respect to the election of Directors, the affirmative vote of the holders
of shares of such class or series representing a majority of the votes present in person or
represented by proxy at the meeting shall be the act of such class or series.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt; text-indent: 12%">(b)&nbsp;Voting at meetings of shareholders need not be by written ballot and need not be conducted
by inspectors of election unless so required by Section&nbsp;1.9 of these Bylaws or so determined by the
holders of stock having a majority of the votes which could be cast by the holders of all
outstanding stock entitled to vote which are present in person or represented by proxy at such
meeting.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt; text-indent: 12%">(c)&nbsp;Stock of the Corporation belonging to the Corporation, or to another Corporation, a
majority of the shares entitled to vote in the election of Directors of which are held by the
Corporation, shall not be voted at any meeting of shareholders and shall not be counted in the
total number of outstanding shares for the purpose of determining whether a quorum is present.
Nothing in this Section&nbsp;1.7 shall limit the right of the Corporation to vote shares of stock of the
Corporation held by it in a fiduciary capacity.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt; text-indent: 4%">Section&nbsp;1.8 (a)&nbsp;Each shareholder entitled to vote at a meeting of shareholders may authorize
another person or persons to act for such shareholder by proxy filed with the Secretary before or
at the time of the meeting. No such proxy shall be voted or acted upon after three years from its
date, unless the proxy provides for a longer period. A duly executed proxy shall be irrevocable if
it states that it is irrevocable and if, and only as long as, it is coupled with an interest
sufficient in law to support an irrevocable power. A shareholder may revoke any proxy which is not
irrevocable by attending the meeting and voting in person or by filing with the Secretary an
instrument in writing revoking the proxy or another duly executed proxy bearing a later date.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt; text-indent: 12%">(a)&nbsp;A shareholder may authorize another person or persons to act for such shareholder as proxy
(i)&nbsp;by executing a writing authorizing such person or persons to act as such, which execution may
be accomplished by such shareholder or such shareholder&#146;s authorized officer, Director, partner,
employee or agent (or, if the stock is held in a trust or estate, by a trustee, executor or
administrator thereof) signing such writing or causing his or her signature to be affixed to such
writing by any reasonable means, including, but not limited to, facsimile signature, or (ii)&nbsp;by
transmitting or authorizing the transmission of a telegram, cablegram or other means of electronic
transmission (a &#147;Transmission&#148;) to the person who will be the holder of the proxy or to a proxy
solicitation firm, proxy support service organization or like agent duly authorized by the person
who will be the holder of the proxy to receive such Transmission; provided that any such
Transmission must either set forth or be submitted with information from which it can be determined
that such Transmission was authorized by such shareholder.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt; text-indent: 12%">(b)&nbsp;Any inspector or inspectors appointed pursuant to Section&nbsp;1.9 of these Bylaws shall
examine each Transmission to determine whether it is valid. If no inspector or inspectors are so
appointed, the Secretary or such other person or persons as shall be appointed from time to time by
the Board of Directors shall examine Transmissions to determine if they are valid. If it is
determined a Transmission is valid, the person or persons making that determination shall specify
the information upon which such person or persons relied. Any copy, facsimile telecommunication or
other reliable reproduction of such a writing or Transmission may be substituted or used in lieu of
the original writing or Transmission for any and all purposes for which the original writing or
Transmission could be used; provided that such copy, facsimile telecommunication or other
reproduction shall be a complete reproduction of the entire original writing or Transmission.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt; text-indent: 4%">Section&nbsp;1.9 Voting Procedures and Inspectors of Elections. (a)&nbsp;Unless otherwise provided in
the Certificate of Incorporation or required by law, the following provisions of this Section&nbsp;1.9
shall apply only if and when the Corporation has a class of voting stock that is (i)&nbsp;listed on a
national securities exchange, (ii)&nbsp;authorized for quotation on an interdealer quotation system of a
registered national securities association or (iii)&nbsp;held of record by more than 2,000 shareholders.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt; text-indent: 12%">(a)&nbsp;The Corporation shall, in advance of any meeting of shareholders, appoint one or more
inspectors of election (individually an &#147;inspector,&#148; and collectively the &#147;inspectors&#148;) to act at
such meeting and make a written report thereof. The Board of Directors may designate one or more
persons as alternate inspectors to replace any inspector who fails to act. If no inspector or
alternate is able to act at such meeting, the chairman of the meeting shall appoint one or more
inspectors to act at the meeting. Each inspector of election, before entering upon the discharge
of his duties, shall take and sign an oath to execute faithfully the duties of inspector with
strict impartiality and according to the best of his ability.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt; text-indent: 12%">(b)&nbsp;The inspectors shall (i)&nbsp;ascertain the number of shares of stock of the Corporation
outstanding and the voting power of each, (ii)&nbsp;determine the number of shares of stock of the
Corporation present in person or by proxy at such meeting and the validity of proxies and ballots,
(iii)&nbsp;count all votes and ballots, (iv)&nbsp;determine and retain for a reasonable period a record of
the disposition of any challenges made to any determination by the inspectors and (v)&nbsp;certify their
determination of the number of such shares present in person or by proxy at such meeting and their
count of all votes and ballots. The inspectors may appoint or retain other persons or entities to
assist them in the performance of their duties.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt; text-indent: 12%">(c)&nbsp;The date and time of the opening and the closing of the polls for each matter upon which
the shareholders will vote at a meeting shall be announced at such meeting. No ballots, proxies or
votes, nor any revocations thereof or changes thereto, shall be accepted by the inspectors after
the closing of the polls unless the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware upon application by
any shareholder shall determine otherwise.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt; text-indent: 12%">(d)&nbsp;In determining the validity and counting of proxies and ballots, the inspectors shall be
limited to an examination of the proxies, any envelopes submitted with such proxies, any
information referred to in paragraphs (b)&nbsp;and (c)&nbsp;of Section&nbsp;1.8 of these Bylaws, ballots and the
regular books and records of the Corporation, except that the inspectors may consider other
reliable information for the limited purpose of reconciling proxies and ballots submitted by or on
behalf of banks, brokers, their nominees or similar persons which represent more votes than the
holder of a proxy is authorized by a shareholder of record to cast or more votes than such
shareholder holds of record. If the inspectors consider other reliable information for the limited
purpose permitted herein, the inspectors, at the time they make their certification pursuant to
paragraph (c)&nbsp;of this Section&nbsp;1.9, shall specify the precise information considered by them,
including the person or persons from whom such information was obtained, when and the means by
which such information was obtained and the basis for the inspectors&#146; belief that such information
is accurate and reliable.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt; text-indent: 4%">Section&nbsp;1.10 Fixing Date of Determination of Shareholders of Record. (a)&nbsp;In order that the
Corporation may determine the shareholders entitled (i)&nbsp;to notice of or to vote at any meeting of
shareholders or any adjournment thereof, (ii)&nbsp;to receive payment of any dividend or other
distribution or allotment of any rights, (iii)&nbsp;to exercise any rights in respect of any change,
conversion or exchange of stock or (iv)&nbsp;to take, receive or participate in any other action, the
Board of Directors may fix a record date, which shall not be earlier than the date upon which the
resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors and which (1)&nbsp;in the case of
a determination of shareholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of shareholders or
adjournment thereof, shall, unless otherwise required by law, be not more than 60 nor less than 10
days before the date of such meeting; and (2)&nbsp;in the case of any other action, shall be not more
than 60&nbsp;days before such action.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt; text-indent: 12%">(a)&nbsp;If no record date is fixed, (i)&nbsp;the record date for determining shareholders entitled to
notice of or to vote at a meeting of shareholders shall be at the close of business on the day next
preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on
the day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held; and (ii)&nbsp;the record date for
determining shareholders for any other purpose shall be at the close of business on the day on
which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution relating thereto.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt; text-indent: 12%">(b)&nbsp;A determination of shareholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of
shareholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting, but the Board of Directors may fix a
new record date for the adjourned meeting.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt; text-indent: 4%">Section&nbsp;1.11 List of Shareholders Entitled to Vote. The Secretary shall prepare, at least 10
days before every meeting of shareholders, a complete list of the shareholders entitled to vote at
the meeting, arranged in alphabetical order, and showing the address and the number of shares
registered in the name of each shareholder. Such list shall be open to the examination of any
shareholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting, during ordinary business hours, for a period
of at least 10&nbsp;days prior to the meeting, either at a place within the city where the meeting is to
be held, which place shall be specified in the notice of meeting, or, if not so specified, at the
place where the meeting is to be held. The list shall also be produced and kept at the time and
place of the meeting during the whole time thereof and may be inspected by any shareholder who is
present. The stock ledger shall be the only evidence as to who are the shareholders entitled to
examine the stock ledger or to vote in person or by proxy at any meeting of shareholders.

be fixed by resolution of the Board of Directors.

Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer, or a majority of the members of the Board of
Directors then in office and may be held at any time, date or place, within or without the State of
Delaware, as the person or persons calling the meeting shall fix. Notice of the time and place of
special meetings shall be delivered personally or by telephone to each Director or sent by

all meetings of the Board of Directors, a majority of the whole Board of Directors shall constitute
a quorum for the transaction of business. Unless the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws
otherwise provide, the vote of a majority of the Directors present at a meeting at which a quorum
is present shall be the act of the Board of Directors. A meeting at which a quorum is initially
present may continue to transact business notwithstanding the withdrawal of Directors, if any
action taken is approved by at least a majority of the required quorum for that meeting.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt; text-indent: 12%">(a)&nbsp;If a quorum is not present at any meeting of the Board of Directors, then the Directors

of Delaware, the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, a written waiver thereof, signed by
the person entitled to notice, whether before or after the time stated therein, shall be deemed
equivalent to notice. Attendance of a person at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of
such meeting, except when the person attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting, at the
beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully
called or convened. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any regular or
special meeting of the Directors, or members of a committee of Directors, need be specified in any
written waiver of notice unless so required by the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt; text-indent: 4%">Section&nbsp;2.7 Telephonic Meetings. Directors, or any committee of Directors designated by the

Section&nbsp;2.7 shall constitute presence in person at such meeting.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt; text-indent: 4%">Section&nbsp;2.8 Informal Action by Directors. Unless otherwise restricted by the Certificate of
Incorporation or these Bylaws, any action required or permitted to be taken at any meeting of the
Board of Directors or of any committee thereof, may be taken without a meeting if all members of
the Board of Directors or such committee, as the case may be, consent thereto in writing (which may
be in counterparts), and the written consent or consents are filed with the minutes of proceedings
of the Board of Directors or such committee.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt; text-indent: 4%">Section&nbsp;2.9 Reliance Upon Records. Every Director, and every member of any committee of the
Board of Directors, shall, in the performance of his or her duties, be fully protected in relying
in good faith upon the records of the Corporation and upon such information, opinions, reports or
statements presented to the Corporation by any of its officers or employees, or committees of the
Board of Directors, or by any other person as to matters the Director or member reasonably believes
are within such other person&#146;s professional or expert competence and who has been selected with
reasonable care by or on behalf of the Corporation, including, but not limited to, such records,

amended.
