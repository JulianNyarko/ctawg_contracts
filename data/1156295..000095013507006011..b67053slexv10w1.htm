rents from Landlord the Leased Premises, together with (i)&nbsp;the right to use (subject to the terms
and conditions hereof), in common with others, the common areas of Building A, Building C, and

install, maintain, use, repair and replace pipes, ducts, conduits, wires, and building service
fixtures and equipment leading to the Leased Premises in locations which will not materially
interfere with Tenant&#146;s use of the Leased Premises or access thereto.

lawful money of the United States, in advance and without abatement, offset, deduction, prior
notice or demand except as otherwise provided herein, and, except to the extent specifically
provided herein, the covenant to pay rent shall be independent of every other covenant in this

immediately preceding twelve (12)&nbsp;month period, Tenant shall have three (3)&nbsp;successive options
(each, an &#147;<U>Extension Option</U>&#148;) to extend the Lease Term for periods of five (5)&nbsp;years each
(each, an &#147;<U>Extension Term</U>&#148;), the first of which Extension Term shall commence on the
termination date of the Initial Term, the second of which shall commence on the day immediately

day immediately following the expiration of the second Extension Term, said extended Lease Terms to
be on the same terms and conditions as the Lease except that (i)&nbsp;the Lease shall contain no further
options to extend after the expiration of the third Extension Term, and (ii)&nbsp;the Base Rent
applicable to each Extension Term shall be computed as set forth below. Tenant shall provide
written notice (&#147;<U>Tenant&#146;s Extension Notice</U>&#148;) to Landlord of its determination to exercise
each such Extension Option no later than twelve (12)&nbsp;months prior to the expiration of the then
current Lease Term (&#147;<U>Notice Date</U>&#148;), otherwise Tenant&#146;s option to extend is waived. Time is

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Base Rent due for each Extension Term shall be the fair market rental rate (the
&#147;<U>Extension Rental Rate</U>&#148;) for the Leased Premises, which is defined as the then prevailing
fair market triple net rental rate for office space at comparable property in the market area of
the Business Park, excluding the value of any Alterations or other improvements made to the Leased
Premises that were paid for by Tenant and taking into consideration factors such as (i)&nbsp;the
percentage of the total Business Park occupied by Tenant, (ii)&nbsp;Tenant&#146;s contribution to the
operating costs of the Business Park, and (iii)&nbsp;any other relevant factors either Tenant or
Landlord wishes to bring to the attention of the other or to a real estate professional called upon
to assist in the determination of the fair market rental rate. The Extension Rental Rate shall be
determined as follows: in the event Tenant timely exercises an Extension Option in accordance
herewith, within ten (10)&nbsp;business days after Landlord receives Tenant&#146;s Extension Notice, Landlord
shall notify Tenant in writing of Landlord&#146;s good faith determination of the fair market rental
rate (&#147;<U>Landlord&#146;s Extension Term Rental Notice</U>&#148;), which notice shall set forth in
reasonable detail Landlord&#146;s determination of such fair market rental rate and shall provide
separately, if Landlord wishes, rent concessions and/or tenant improvement allowances that Landlord
may wish to offer, and the amount by which Landlord&#146;s estimate of the fair market rental rate would
increase as a result of the granting of such concessions (the &#147;<U>Concession Rate Amount</U>&#148;) and
shall set forth Landlord&#146;s determination of the expiration date of the Negotiation Period. Tenant
shall have ten (10)&nbsp;business days from the date of Landlord&#146;s Extension Term Rental Notice to
either accept or dispute Landlord&#146;s determination of the fair market rental rate. In the event
that Tenant disputes Landlord&#146;s determination of the fair market rental rate, Tenant shall so
notify Landlord and advise Landlord of Tenant&#146;s determination of the fair market rental rate (which
notice shall set forth in reasonable detail Tenant&#146;s determination of the fair market rental rate
as well as concessions and improvement allowances it may be seeking, including an alternate
Concession Rate Amount). If Landlord and Tenant cannot agree upon the Extension Rental Rate within
sixty (60)&nbsp;days of the date of Landlord&#146;s Extension Term Rental Notice (the &#147;<U>Negotiation
Period</U>&#148;), Tenant, at Tenant&#146;s option, shall give Landlord, within three (3)&nbsp;business days of
the expiration of the Negotiation Period, one of the following written notices: (a)&nbsp;a written
notice revoking Tenant&#146;s exercise of such Extension Option, or (b)&nbsp;a written notice stating that
Tenant wishes to submit the matter to arbitration as set forth herein. If Tenant does not provide
either notice, the exercise of such Extension Option shall be deemed revoked. If option (b)&nbsp;is
chosen, Landlord and Tenant shall simultaneously exchange, on the fifth (5th) business day
following the expiration of the Negotiation Period, statements setting forth each such party&#146;s
final determination of the fair market rental rate (each, a &#147;<U>Statement of Rental Rate</U>&#148;),
including any Concession Rate Amount (separately stated), together with such backup information as
to such party&#146;s determination of the fair market rental rate and/or any Concession Rate Amount as
such party wishes to include(and, in the case of Landlord, the fair market rental rate in such

in response to Landlord&#146;s Extension Term Rental Notice); provided, however, that if one party does
not submit a Statement of Rental Rate, then the determination of the fair market rental rate set
forth in the other party&#146;s Statement of Rental Rate shall be established as the Extension Rental
Rate applicable to such Extension Term. If both parties receive the other party&#146;s Statement of
Rental Rate within such time and the higher of the two (2)&nbsp;determinations of the fair market rental
rate is equal to or less than 110% of the lesser determination, then the Extension Rental Rate
shall be the average of the two determinations. Otherwise, Landlord and Tenant shall mutually
select a real estate professional with at least ten (10)&nbsp;years&#146; continuous experience in the
business of appraising or marketing multi-tenant mix-use buildings in the greater Boston area (the
&#147;<U>Valuation Expert</U>&#148;) to resolve the dispute as to the Extension Rental Rate. If Landlord
and Tenant cannot agree upon the designation of the Valuation Expert within ten (10)&nbsp;business days
of the exchange of the Statements of Rental Rate, either party may apply to the American
Arbitration Association, the Greater Boston Real Estate Board, or any successor thereto, for the
designation of a Valuation Expert. Within five (5)&nbsp;business days of the selection of the Valuation
Expert, Landlord and Tenant shall each submit to the Valuation Expert a copy of its Statement of
Rental Rate, together with any supporting material. The Valuation Expert shall not perform his own
valuation, but rather, shall, within fifteen (15)&nbsp;business days after receipt of such submissions,
select as the Extension Rental Rate the submission which the Valuation Expert concludes most
closely and accurately reflects the fair market rental rate for the Leased Premises and the fair
market rental rate set forth in that submission shall be the Extension Rental Rate for such
Extension Term. The Valuation Expert shall give notice of his or her determination to Landlord and
Tenant, and such decision shall be final and conclusively binding upon Landlord and Tenant. In
addition, Tenant shall be entitled to elect to take advantage of the concessions last offered by
Landlord and include the Concession Rate Amount in the Extension Rental Rate by notice to Landlord
given within thirty (30)&nbsp;days of the final determination by the Valuation Expert. Each party shall
pay the fees and expenses of any real estate professional such party retains and such party&#146;s
counsel, if any, in connection with any proceeding under this paragraph, and the party whose
determination of the fair market rental rate was determined by the Valuation Expert not to most
accurately and closely reflect the fair market rental rate of the Leased Premises shall pay the
fees and expenses of the Valuation Expert.

the applicable Extension Term, which amendment shall set forth the Extension Term, the Extension
Rental Rate, and all other terms and conditions for such Extension Term; provided, however, any
failure to execute such amendment shall not affect such Extension Term or any terms or conditions

Lease Term, Landlord shall submit to Tenant a statement certifying (i)&nbsp;actual overall Business Park
Operating Expenses, Building D Operating Expenses, Building A, Building B and Building C Operating
Expenses, and Building Specific Expenses for Buildings A, B and C, and Landlord&#146;s determination of
Tenant&#146;s Operating Expenses for the preceding calendar year, including commercially reasonable

after giving ten (10)&nbsp;days&#146; advance written notice to Landlord, to inspect and audit Landlord&#146;s
books and records relating to Tenant&#146;s Operating Expenses billed during such calendar year falling
within the Lease Term and covered by such year end statement. The books and records shall be kept
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles consistently applied. If as a result
of such audit it becomes clear that an error was made in the calculation of Tenant&#146;s Operating
Expenses, then an appropriate adjustment to Tenant&#146;s Operating Expenses shall be made promptly. If

upon receipt of an accounting of any such sums, within five (5)&nbsp;business days of demand, pay to the
Landlord the sum so applied or retained which shall be added to the Security Deposit so that the

Security Deposit, or any balance thereof, shall be returned to the Tenant, provided that if Tenant
is so in default, the Security Deposit, or any balance thereof, may be applied to such cure (in
which case Landlord shall provide Tenant with an accounting as to the use and application of the
Security Deposit or any portion thereof and the balance shall be returned to Tenant). If the
Business Park or any Building of which the Leased Premises are a part is sold, Landlord shall
transfer and assign the Security Deposit and Letter of Credit to the purchaser, and, upon such
transfer and assignment, Landlord shall be released by Tenant from all liability for the return of
such Security Deposit to the extent that Landlord actually transfers and assigns the Security

Tenant agrees that it will not assign or encumber moneys deposited as security and that neither
Landlord nor its successors or assigns shall be bound by any such assignment, encumbrance,
attempted assignments or attempted encumbrances.

plate numbers of the automobiles operated by Tenant, its officers, employees and agents. The
Landlord may (upon at least 24 hours advance notice to Tenant, except in case of emergency) at any
time temporarily close any exterior common area to make repairs or changes or to discourage
non-customer parking and may do such other acts in and to the exterior common areas as in its

either party hereto, with the exceptions of those provisions of the Lease that survive expiration
or termination thereof. Landlord further acknowledges that all of Tenant&#146;s trade fixtures and
other personal property located on or within the Leased Premises or the Business Park on the date
hereof shall be and remain the property of Tenant notwithstanding the termination of the Existing
Lease.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tenant hereby represents and warrants to Landlord that Tenant&#146;s First Amended Joint Plan of
Reorganization of the Debtor and the Ad Hoc Equity Committee, as Modified (the &#147;<U>Plan</U>&#148;) was
confirmed by an order entered on February&nbsp;21, 2007 in its Chapter&nbsp;11 bankruptcy case in the United
States Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of California (the &#147;<U>Bankruptcy Court</U>&#148;), Case No.
06-00510-LA11. The Plan became effective on May&nbsp;17, 2007, on which date Tenant emerged from
bankruptcy. While there is still some ongoing litigation in the Bankruptcy Court regarding claims
to which Tenant has previously objected, as of May&nbsp;17, 2007, any person with a claim against or
interest in Tenant arising prior to May&nbsp;17, 2007 is permanently enjoined from taking any action
against Tenant with respect to such claim, which action is not specifically provided for in the
Plan. Prior obligations are payable solely as provided in the Plan.

is not to be deemed to be an offer to lease and will not be binding upon either party until
executed and delivered by both parties. This Lease shall be conditioned upon Landlord&#146;s receipt of
approval thereof from the holder of the existing Mortgage. There are no oral or written agreements

Agreement are for convenience only and shall not be considered in construing this Lease. Unless
repugnant to the context, the words &#147;Landlord&#148; and &#147;Tenant&#148; appearing in this Lease shall be

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Landlord shall be in default in the performance of any obligation required to be performed by
Landlord under the Lease if Landlord has failed to perform such obligation within thirty (30)&nbsp;days
after the receipt of notice from Tenant specifying in reasonable detail Landlord&#146;s failure to
perform; provided, however, that if the nature of Landlord&#146;s obligation is such that more than
thirty (30)&nbsp;days are required for its performance, Landlord shall not be deemed in default if it
shall commence such performance within thirty (30)&nbsp;days and thereafter diligently and in good faith

materially interferes with Tenant&#146;s ability to operate its business in the Leased Premises or
unreasonably interferes with Tenant&#146;s access to the Premises, Tenant may exercise any of its rights
provided at law or in equity and shall have the right, but not the obligation, upon prior written

(provided that if such cure relates to building systems, Tenant shall use reasonable efforts to
engage the contractor generally used by Landlord to make such repairs) and to deduct from Tenant&#146;s
payment of Tenant&#146;s Operating Expenses the costs incurred by Tenant to cure such Landlord Default,

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.&nbsp;<U>Landlord&#146;s Approval of Construction Documents</U>. Except as otherwise set forth in
the Lease, Tenant shall not perform any alterations (which term shall include the Tenant Work),
additions or improvements to the Leased Premises (&#147;<U>Alterations</U>&#148;) until Tenant has received
Landlord&#146;s prior written approval (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) of such
Alterations. Whenever Tenant seeks to obtain Landlord&#146;s approval of any Alteration, Tenant shall,
prior to commencing such Alteration, submit to Landlord permit-ready, detailed drawings and
specifications (&#147;<U>Construction Documents</U>&#148;) prepared and stamped by an architect or engineer
(either such professional, &#147;<U>Tenant&#146;s Architect</U>&#148;) registered in the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts and approved by Landlord, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed. The Construction Documents, to the extent applicable to the specific Alteration
proposed by Tenant, shall set forth in detail the requirements for construction of the Alterations
(including all architectural, mechanical, electrical, plumbing, fire protection and structural
drawings and detailed specifications), shall be fully coordinated with one another and with field
conditions as they exist in the Leased Premises (or such portion thereof as is being altered) and
elsewhere in the applicable Building, and shall show all work necessary to complete the Alterations
including all cutting, fitting, and patching and all connections to the mechanical and electrical
systems and components of such Building. Upon the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease,
Tenant agrees to assign to Landlord, without representation, warranty or recourse, on a
non-exclusive basis, any rights Tenant may have with respect to the Construction Documents and any
representations or warranties made by the preparer thereof. Landlord&#146;s approval of Construction
Documents shall signify only Landlord&#146;s consent to the Alterations shown thereon and shall not
result in any responsibility of Landlord concerning compliance of the Alterations with laws,
regulations, or codes, or coordination of any aspect of the Alterations with any other aspect of
the Alterations or any component or system of such Building, or the feasibility of constructing the
Alterations without damage or harm to such Building, all of which shall be the sole responsibility
of Tenant.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Landlord shall approve or disapprove the Construction Documents within ten (10)&nbsp;business days
of Landlord&#146;s receipt thereof, provided that Tenant has notified Landlord, at least two (2)&nbsp;weeks
in advance, of the date that it anticipates that it will submit the Construction Documents to
Landlord (and, in any event within twenty (20)&nbsp;business days after receipt thereof, whether or not
such notice is given). Landlord acknowledges and agrees that such notice has been given with
respect to the Tenant Work in Premises D. If Landlord disapproves the Construction Documents,
Landlord shall specify the reasons for such disapproval, and Tenant shall re-submit revised
Construction Documents to Landlord for approval (to be granted or withheld within six (6)&nbsp;business
days of receipt thereof). Failure of Landlord to approve or disapprove plans and specifications
within the applicable time period after original submission (10 or 20 business days), or six (6)
business days after resubmission of the same, shall constitute Landlord&#146;s approval thereof. Any
disapproval of plans and specifications shall be accompanied by a specific statement of the
reason(s) therefore. It shall be reasonable for Landlord to withhold its consent to any Alteration
that (i)&nbsp;may exceed the capacity of or adversely affect the capacity, maintenance, operating costs
or integrity of the applicable Building or its structures or systems, as reasonably determined by
Landlord, (ii)&nbsp;the mere making of which violates any agreement entered into prior to this Lease
that affects the Business Park or that is either recorded in the Worcester Registry of Deeds or
became binding upon Landlord prior to the date of this Lease and has been provided to Tenant for
review (Landlord hereby representing and warranting that it will not enter into any agreement after
the date hereof which would prevent any such Alterations for any Permitted Use of the Leased
Premises), and/or (iii)&nbsp;is not approved by the holder of any Mortgage superior to the Lease or the
lessor under any ground lease or other lease superior to the Lease at the time the work is
proposed. In addition, with respect to any floor not occupied entirely by Tenant, Tenant shall
neither propose nor effect any Alterations consisting of improvements, additions, or alterations to
the entranceway to any adjoining elevator lobby, corridor or common areas. If, after the
Construction Documents have been approved by Landlord, Tenant requests

shall obtain Landlord&#146;s written approval of such change(s) (not to be unreasonably withheld,

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.&nbsp;<U>Commencement of Construction</U>. Prior to commencement of construction, (i)&nbsp;Tenant
shall deliver to Landlord a request for approval of the person or entity (including any employee or
agent of Tenant) performing such Alterations (&#147;<U>Tenant Contractor</U>&#148;), which approval shall
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, and (ii)&nbsp;Tenant or Tenant&#146;s Contractor or construction
manager shall submit the approved Construction Documents to the appropriate governmental agencies
for plan checking and the issuance of a building permit and any other permits necessary to
construct such improvements (the &#147;<U>Permits</U>&#148;) (with respect to the Tenant Work, such
submission shall be made no later than ten (10)&nbsp;business days after the last to occur of (i)
Landlord&#146;s approval of the Construction Documents and Tenant&#146;s Contractor, and (ii)&nbsp;Landlord&#146;s
delivery of the Premises D to Tenant in broom clean condition, free and clear of any and all
existing tenants and their personal property), and once received, Tenant shall deliver the
following items to Landlord: (a)&nbsp;sworn statements, including the names, addresses and copies of
contracts for all contractors; (b)&nbsp;at Landlord&#146;s election, all necessary governmental permits,
licenses and approvals evidencing compliance with all applicable Legal Requirements; (c)
certificates of insurance, issued by a responsible insurance company or surety company (as
applicable) qualified to do business in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and reasonably approved
by Landlord (a &#147;<U>Qualified Insurance Company</U>&#148;), evidencing the insurance required by
<U>Exhibit&nbsp;C-1</U> hereto, naming Landlord and any other parties designated by Landlord as
additional insureds; (d)&nbsp;for Alterations requiring Landlord&#146;s consent and costing more than
$500,000 a statutory lien bond pursuant to M.G.L. c. 254, &#167;12 or any successor statute (or such
other protection of Landlord&#146;s interest in the Property against liens as Landlord may reasonably
require), in each case for the benefit of Landlord, and issued by a Qualified Insurance Company,
and (e)&nbsp;all other documents and information as Landlord may reasonably request in connection with
the construction of any Alteration.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.&nbsp;<U>Construction</U>. All Alterations shall be performed in a good and workmanlike manner,
in accordance with the approved Construction Documents, and shall meet or exceed the standards for
construction and quality of materials established by Landlord for the Business Park. Once
commenced, each Alteration shall be diligently prosecuted to completion by Tenant. In addition,
all Alterations shall be performed at Tenant&#146;s sole risk and in compliance with all applicable
Legal Requirements, and all regulations and requirements of Landlord&#146;s and Tenant&#146;s insurers. In
performing any Alteration, each Tenant Contractor shall comply with Landlord&#146;s reasonable
requirements relating to the time and methods for such work, use of delivery elevators and other
building facilities; and each Tenant Contractor shall not unreasonably interfere or disrupt any
other tenant or other person using the Building. Each Tenant Contractor shall in all events work
on the Premises without causing labor disharmony, coordination difficulties, or delay or impair any
guaranties, warranties or obligations of any contractors of Landlord. Tenant shall pay Landlord
for all reasonable, out-of-pocket costs and expenses of Building services and facilities associated
with any Alteration, including use of the freight elevator, sprinkler shutdown, debris removal and
all other costing charges associated with any Alteration. If any Tenant Contractor uses any
Building services or facilities, such Contractor, jointly and severally with Tenant, shall agree to
reimburse Landlord for the reasonable cost thereof. Each Tenant Contractor shall, by entry into
the Business Park, be deemed to have agreed to indemnify and hold Landlord and its partners,
affiliates, officers, agents, servants and employees and Landlord&#146;s management, leasing and
development agents and Landlord&#146;s mortgagee(s) (the &#147;<U>Indemnitees</U>&#148;), harmless from any
claim, loss or expense arising in whole or in part out of any act or omission committed by such
person while in any Building or at the Business Park, to the same extent as Tenant has so agreed in

under Tenant&#146;s construction agreement with Tenant&#146;s contractor, directly to Tenant&#146;s Contractor all
costs of any Alterations, so that the Property shall always be free of liens for labor or
materials. If any such lien shall exist, Tenant shall, within ten (10)&nbsp;days after the filing of
such lien, (or such shorter period if required by the terms of any Mortgage) have such lien
discharged of record or deliver to Landlord a recordable bond in form, amount, and issued by a
surety reasonably satisfactory to Landlord, indemnifying Landlord and the holder of any Mortgage (a
&#147;<U>Mortgagee</U>&#148;) against all out-of-pocket costs and liabilities resulting from such lien and
the foreclosure or attempted foreclosure thereof. If Tenant fails to have such lien so released or
to deliver such bond to Landlord, Landlord or the Mortgagee, without investigating the validity of
such lien, may pay or discharge the same; and Tenant shall reimburse Landlord or the Mortgagee, as
applicable, within ten (10)&nbsp;days of demand for the amount so paid by Landlord or the Mortgagee,
including expenses and attorneys&#146; fees. Tenant hereby indemnifies Landlord against liability for
any mechanics&#146; and other liens filed in connection with the costs of any and all Alterations,
including the liens of any chattel mortgages, security agreements or financing statements upon any
materials or fixtures installed in and constituting part of the Leased Premises. Finally, upon
completion of any Alteration, Tenant shall promptly furnish Landlord with sworn contractor&#146;s
acknowledgements of payment in full and final waivers of lien in form required by statute covering
all labor and materials included in such Alteration.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whereas, Landlord and Tenant have entered into those certain leases dated the dates set forth
on <U>Exhibit&nbsp;A</U> attached hereto and made a part hereof (collectively, the &#147;<U>Lease</U>&#148;),
pursuant to which Tenant is leasing certain premises at Birchwood Business Park, 25 Birch Street,
Milford, MA, which property is more fully described on <U>Exhibit&nbsp;B</U> (the &#147;<U>Premises</U>&#148;)
from Landlord; and
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whereas, Tenant and Lender have entered or are about to enter into certain financing
arrangements (the &#147;<U>Financing</U>&#148;) under which Tenant is obtaining loans from Lender secured
by, among other things, certain of the tangible and intangible property of Tenant, including,
without limitation, all of Tenant&#146;s goods, inventory, machinery, equipment, furniture and fixtures,
together with all additions, substitutions, replacements and improvements to, and proceeds of, the
foregoing (collectively, the &#147;<U>Collateral</U>&#148;). For purposes of this Agreement, with the
exception of trade fixtures (as defined in the Lease) the &#147;<U>Collateral</U>&#148; shall not include
(a)&nbsp;any heating, ventilating and/or air conditioning system heretofore or hereafter installed in or
on the building of which the Premises is a part, including any and all wires, cables, thermostats
and ducts relating thereto, or (b)&nbsp;any other fixtures.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whereas, in connection with the Financing, Lender has requested, and Landlord has agreed,
subject to the following conditions, to enter into this Agreement.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants contained herein, and for other good
and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, Landlord,
Tenant and Lender hereby agree as follows:
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.&nbsp;Notwithstanding the provisions of the Lease or applicable law, the Landlord and Lender
agree as follows:
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;Subject to the terms hereof, Landlord acknowledges the validity of Lender&#146;s security
interests and liens on the Collateral and, until such time as all liabilities of Tenant to Lender
and all expenses now or hereafter owing by Tenant to Lender under the Loan Documents have been
finally and irrevocably paid to or recovered by Lender in full and all covenants of Tenant to
Lender have been fully performed, Landlord disclaims and waives all claims or interests in the
Collateral and agrees not to distrain or levy upon the Collateral or to assert any lien, security
interest, right of distrain or other claim against the Collateral for any reason; and
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.&nbsp;Landlord acknowledges that to the best of its knowledge, (a)&nbsp;a true and correct copy of the
Lease as in effect as of the date hereof is attached hereto as <U>Exhibit&nbsp;A-1</U>, (b)&nbsp;the Lease
is in full force and effect, and (c)&nbsp;Landlord is not aware of any existing default under the Lease.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.&nbsp;Landlord, Tenant and Lender agree that in the event Tenant shall be in default under the
terms of the Financing or any other instrument executed by Tenant in connection therewith

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">the &#147;<U>Loan Documents</U>&#148;), or in the event for any reason that Lender shall be entitled to
take possession of any or all of the Collateral situated in or at the Premises, Lender shall have,
and is hereby granted, a license (the &#147;<U>License</U>&#148;) to enter upon the Premises as may be
reasonably necessary to enable Lender to secure, take possession of, sell by private sale or public
auction, prepare for removal and remove the Collateral from the Premises, and for purposes that are
incidental to such activities, but for no other purpose. The License shall be effective during
normal business hours only. Lender, while exercising the License, shall not unreasonably interfere
with the other tenants of the property on which the Premises is located (&#147;<U>Landlord&#146;s
Project</U>&#148;), shall not breach the peace and shall be responsible for compliance with applicable
law. Lender agrees to give Landlord at least two (2)&nbsp;day&#146;s prior written notice of Lender&#146;s initial
exercise of the License. The License is further described in, and subject to the conditions and
limitations set forth in, Paragraph&nbsp;4 below.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.&nbsp;The License is a license to enter upon the Premises during the ninety (90)&nbsp;calendar day
period commencing on the effective date of Lender&#146;s notice to Landlord pursuant to Paragraph&nbsp;3
above, or the effective date of Landlord&#146;s notice to Lender pursuant to Paragraph&nbsp;6 below,
whichever shall first occur, and terminating on the ninetieth (90th) calendar day following
Landlord&#146;s entry upon the Premises. In the event that Lender exercises the License, Lender shall
pay to Landlord, periodically (but not less frequently than weekly, and in advance), with respect
to each day Lender uses the Premises or that the Collateral remains in the Premises during the
above-described period, commencing on the second (2nd) day of such period (there being no charge
for the first day of such period), a daily license fee equal to one-thirtieth (1/30th) of the non
default monthly rental then applicable as provided in the Lease, unless Landlord has otherwise been
paid rent in respect of any of such period, without incurring any obligations of Tenant, or
acquiring any rights of Tenant. Any extensions of the foregoing period shall be only with the
prior written consent of Landlord, withheld or conditioned in Landlord&#146;s sole discretion.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, upon breach of the terms of this License
by Lender and Lender&#146;s failure to cure such breach to the reasonable satisfaction of Landlord
within ten (10)&nbsp;days of receipt by Lender of written notice of such breach, this License shall
automatically terminate and Lender shall promptly vacate the Landlord&#146;s Project.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.&nbsp;Tenant agrees that a written statement from Lender to Landlord and/or Tenant stating that
Tenant is in default as provided in Paragraph&nbsp;3 above, or that Lender is otherwise entitled to
possession of any or all of the Collateral situated in or at the Premises, shall be sufficient to
authorize Lender&#146;s access to the Premises and the Collateral situated therein and thereon. Tenant
hereby releases Landlord from, and agrees to indemnify, defend and hold Landlord harmless from, any
and all claims or causes of action to which Tenant might be entitled as a result of Landlord&#146;s
permitting Lender (or its agents or employees) to enter the Premises and take possession of the
Collateral. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Tenant agrees that Landlord shall
have no duty or obligation whatsoever (a)&nbsp;to inquire about or determine whether Tenant is in fact
in default under the Loan Documents, or (b)&nbsp;to inquire about or question the authenticity,
authorization or due execution of any notice or statement from Lender to Landlord asserting or
alleging a default by Tenant under any instrument evidencing or securing a debt of Tenant to Lender
or otherwise indicating Lender&#146;s intention to exercise its rights hereunder.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.&nbsp;Landlord agrees that if, as a result of an event of default by Tenant under the Lease,
Landlord intends to terminate the Lease or Tenant&#146;s possession of the Premises, Landlord shall
provide written notice of such intention to Lender, provided that (i)&nbsp;Lender shall have at least
fifteen (15)&nbsp;days following receipt at such notice to cure such default before the Lease terminates
and/or Landlord exercises any of its remedies, and (ii)&nbsp;Lender shall not be under any obligation
to, but at its option may, cure any default by Tenant under the Lease. No action by Lender
hereunder shall constitute or be deemed to be an assumption by Lender of any obligation under the
Lease. Lender shall have the right to remove the Collateral from the Premises within thirty (30)
days after the effective date of such written notice. Lender&#146;s entry into the Premises, and
removal of the Collateral, pursuant to this Paragraph&nbsp;6 shall be an

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7.&nbsp;Lender hereby agrees that it shall indemnify, defend and hold Landlord harmless from any
and all claims, actions, liabilities, losses, costs, damages or expenses (including, without
limitation, reasonable attorney&#146;s fees) incurred by Landlord and caused by the act or omission of
Lender, its agents or employees, on or at the Landlord&#146;s Project. Lender&#146;s obligation shall
survive the termination of the License with respect to acts or omissions occurring prior to such
termination.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8.&nbsp;Lender hereby agrees that it shall repair any damage to the Premises or the Landlord&#146;s
Project caused by Lender, or Lender&#146;s agents or employees, during the period in which Lender or its
agents or employees are in or on the Premises or the Landlord&#146;s Project. Lender&#146;s obligation shall
survive the termination of the License. All such repairs shall be performed by a contractor or
contractors approved by Landlord, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed and/or
conditioned; provided, however, that the obligations set forth in Paragraph&nbsp;7 and 8 which expressly
survive termination of the License, will continue in full force and effect until finally completed.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9.&nbsp;This Agreement shall in all respects be a continuing agreement (subject to the terms and
limitations hereof) and shall remain in full force and effect until the date that all liabilities
of Tenant to Lender and all expenses now or hereafter owing by Tenant to Lender under the Loan
Documents have been finally and irrevocably paid to or recovered by Lender in full and all
covenants and conditions of Tenant to Lender have been fully performed; provided, however, that the
provisions of this Agreement concerning the License shall terminate upon termination of the License
in accordance herewith; Landlord and Tenant hereby agreeing that the License may only be revoked by
Landlord pursuant to the provisions of paragraph 4 hereof.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10.&nbsp;If any order or injunction is issued or stay granted which prohibits Lender from
exercising any of its rights hereunder, the periods set forth above in Paragraphs 4 and 6 shall be
tolled during the period of such prohibition.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11.&nbsp;All notices any party hereunder shall be given in writing, mailed or delivered to such
party at the address of such party set forth below or at such other address as either party may
hereafter designate.

Equipment Area.&#148; The overall dimensions of the generator diesel fuel tank(s) and the type of
generator(s), tank(s) and related piping, as well as the location and installation methods of any
necessary conduits shall be subject to the approval of Landlord in its reasonable discretion
(collectively, the &#147;Generator Equipment&#148;). Landlord&#146;s approval of the installation and use of the
Generator Equipment shall not be deemed consent by Landlord to the installation of any other
generator or tank or the right to engage in any other use of any hazardous substance.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.&nbsp;<U>Plans</U>. Prior to the installation of any Generator Equipment, Tenant shall deliver
to Landlord a copy of all plans and specifications for the Generator Equipment for review and
approval by Landlord in its reasonable discretion, and after approval of the plans and
specifications, a copy of all applicable permits for the installation and operation of the
Generator Equipment. Landlord shall specify the method of shielding the Generator Equipment from
view, or other decorative architectural features required to make the Generator Equipment
aesthetically pleasing in Landlord&#146;s reasonable discretion.

the construction and installation of any Generator Equipment.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.&nbsp;<U>Non-Responsibility</U>. Tenant agrees and understands that the review of all plans by
Landlord is solely to protect the interests of Landlord in the Property, and Landlord shall not be
the guarantor of, nor responsible for, the correctness, completeness or accuracy of any such plans
or compliance of such plans with applicable laws, ordinances and regulations. Landlord&#146;s approval
of any plans, work or any matter shall not: (a)&nbsp;impose any present or future liability on Landlord;
(b)&nbsp;constitute a waiver of Landlord&#146;s rights hereunder or under the Lease; (c)&nbsp;impose on Landlord
any responsibility for a design and/or construction defect or fault in any Generator Equipment, (d)
constitute a representation or warranty regarding the accuracy, completeness or correctness thereof
of any plans, or that such plans comply with any laws, rules, regulations, ordinances, or that any
work is in accordance with industry standards or will make the Generator Equipment operational or
functional upon completion. Accordingly, Landlord (and its agents) shall not be responsible for
any defect, flaw, error or omission in such plans, specifications or work, nor shall any inspection
or failure to inspect by Landlord constitute a waiver of any right of Landlord under this Lease or
give rise to any liability thereby on the part of Landlord or its agents.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.&nbsp;<U>Compliance</U>. Tenant shall fully and timely comply with all applicable Legal
Requirements relating to installation and operation of any Generator Equipment, as well as all
provisions of this Lease. The installation, use, operation and maintenance of any Generator
Equipment by Tenant must be done in a manner that will not impair, void or adversely affect any
warranty that Landlord may have at any time. Without limitation on the generality of the
foregoing, Tenant shall secure and maintain in force and effect all governmental licenses, permits
and approvals required for the installation and use of any Generator Equipment, including any
requisite building permits, and shall deliver copies of same to Landlord promptly after receipt by
Tenant from the applicable governmental authority. In connection therewith, Tenant shall not cause
or permit the release, as defined under any applicable state or local law,

Tenant (after Tenant has provided notice thereof to Landlord,) to perform a load test on the Backup
Power System at any time in order to confirm that Tenant is able to use 50% of the capacity of the
Backup Power System. Tenant, upon receipt of Landlord&#146;s prior written approval (not to be
unreasonably withheld), may install, at Tenant&#146;s sole cost and expense, such conduits as are
necessary to connect the Premises to the Backup Power System (collectively, &#147;<U>Tenant&#146;s
Equipment</U>&#148;). At all times during the Term hereof, Tenant shall maintain, at Tenant&#146;s sole cost
and expense, Tenant&#146;s Equipment in good, operational working order and condition and in compliance

Regulations. Tenant shall pay to Landlord its share of all utility and fuel costs, determined by
Landlord in its reasonable discretion, associated with Tenant&#146;s use of the Backup Power System.
Landlord shall maintain the Backup Power System in accordance with commercially reasonable
standards; provided, however, Tenant acknowledges that (a)&nbsp;Landlord makes no warranty or
representation with respect to the Backup Power System or its suitability for Tenant&#146;s use, and (b)
Landlord shall have no responsibility or liability to Tenant in connection with any failures of
such Backup Power System, other than due to failures resulting from Landlord&#146;s willful misconduct.
Tenant hereby releases Landlord and its property manager and their respective agents and employees,
and waives any and all claims for damage or injury to person or property or loss of business
sustained by Tenant, in connection with or resulting from the Backup Power System becoming in
disrepair (unless caused by Landlord&#146;s willful misconduct), malfunctioning, or failing, all as
further set forth in the Lease which shall apply to the license granted herein.
