effect from time to time.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 4%">(b) (i)&nbsp;The Executive shall receive, on each of July&nbsp;1, 2009, October&nbsp;1, 2009,
January&nbsp;4, 2010, and April&nbsp;1, 2010 (each date, a &#147;Grant Date&#148;), shares of the
Company&#146;s common stock equal in number to (A)&nbsp;18,900, if the closing price per share
of the Company&#146;s common stock on the applicable Grant Date, measured in U.S. dollars

Section&nbsp;3.4(b).

amounts as the Company in its discretion determines may be required to be withheld
for tax purposes with respect to the delivery of shares (pursuant to this Section
3.4(b)) on such Grant Date; <I>provided</I>, that if for any reason the Company&#146;s
withholdings during the quarter preceding a Grant Date are insufficient to provide
for any required tax withholding with respect to shares or other amounts to be
delivered on such Grant Date, the Executive shall upon request from the Company and
prior to the delivery of such shares or other amounts promptly pay the Company, in
cash, any shortfall in such required withholding.

Company shall deliver to the Executive (or, in the event of her death, the
Executive&#146;s estate), an amount of shares of the Company&#146;s common stock equal to (i)
the number of shares to which the Executive would have otherwise been entitled under

cash. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may in its discretion pay to the
Executive the cash value of the shares to which the Executive is otherwise entitled
under this Section&nbsp;3.4(c), in lieu of such shares. The cash value of the shares
shall be calculated based upon the closing price per share of the Company&#146;s common
