<U>Severability</U>. If this Section 6.12 is more restrictive than permitted by the laws of any jurisdiction in which Buyer seeks enforcement hereof, this Section 6.12 shall be limited to the extent required to permit enforcement under such laws. In
particular, the parties intend that the covenants contained in Section 6.12(a) shall be construed as a series of separate covenants, one for each county and city in which the Business has been carried on and in which Buyer conducts a similar
business after the Closing Date. Except for geographic coverage, each such separate covenant shall be deemed identical in terms. If, in any proceeding, a court or arbitrator shall refuse to enforce any of the separate covenants, then such
unenforceable covenant shall be deemed eliminated from this Section 6.12 for the purpose of those proceedings to the extent necessary to permit the remaining separate covenants to be enforced. If the provisions of this Section 6.12 shall ever be
deemed to exceed the duration or geographic limitations or scope permitted by applicable law, then such provisions shall be reformed to the maximum time or geographic limitations in scope, as the case may be, permitted by applicable Regulations.
