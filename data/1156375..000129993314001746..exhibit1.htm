outstanding Swingline Loans) in the respective Applicable Tranche to be held ratably by all
Applicable Banks in the respective Applicable Tranche in accordance with their respective

the 2.7(b) Effective Date to the extent necessary to keep the outstanding Loans in the respective
Applicable Tranche ratable with any revised Applicable Percentages arising from any nonratable

in Applicable Tranche Swingline Loans pursuant to <U>Section&nbsp;2.14</U>, the pro rata portion
and &#147;Applicable Percentage&#148; of each non-Defaulting Bank shall be computed from time to time
without giving effect to the Applicable Tranche Commitment of that Defaulting Bank with
respect to each Applicable Tranche; <U>provided</U> that, (i)&nbsp;each such reallocation shall
be given effect if, at the time of any such reallocation, no Default or Unmatured Default
exists; and (ii)&nbsp;the aggregate obligation of each non-Defaulting Bank to acquire, refinance
or fund participations in the Applicable Tranche Swingline Loans shall not exceed the
positive difference, if any, of (1)&nbsp;the Applicable Tranche Commitment of that non-Defaulting

that Bank

longer be deemed to be a Defaulting Bank, the Administrative Agent will so notify the parties
hereto, whereupon as of the effective date specified in such notice and subject to any conditions
set forth therein, that Bank will, to the extent applicable, purchase that portion of outstanding

Swingline Loans to be held on a pro rata basis by the Banks in the Applicable Tranche in accordance
with their Applicable Percentages (without giving effect to <U>Section&nbsp;2.11(a)(iv)</U>), whereupon

Defaulting Bank); and <U>provided</U>, <U>further</U>, that except to the extent otherwise
expressly agreed by the affected parties, no change hereunder from Defaulting Bank to Bank will
constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from that Bank&#146;s having
been a Defaulting Bank.

Applicable Banks), and the Administrative Agent shall promptly pay to such Applicable Tranche
Swingline Bank the amounts so received by it from the Applicable Banks. The Administrative Agent

be required to), in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the applicable Banks the amount
due. In such event, if the Company has not in fact made such payment, then each of the applicable

distributed to such Bank together with interest thereon in respect of each day during the period
commencing on the Business Day immediately following the date of such demand and ending on (but

shall be legally entitled thereto pursuant to an order of a court of competent jurisdiction, each
such amount (or any lesser amount) that is received from each Bank. Administrative Agent shall

a waiver of any Default or an acquiescence therein, and the making of a Loan notwithstanding the
existence of a Default or the inability of the Company to satisfy the conditions precedent to such
Loan shall not constitute any waiver or acquiescence, regardless of whether the Administrative
Agent or any Bank may have had notice or knowledge of such Default at the time. Any single or
partial exercise of any such right shall not preclude other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right, and no waiver, amendment or other variation of the terms, conditions
or provisions of the Loan Documents whatsoever shall be valid unless the same shall be permitted by
<U>Section&nbsp;9.2</U>, and then only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which given.
All remedies contained in the Loan Documents or by law afforded shall be cumulative and all shall
be available to the Banks until the Obligations have been paid in full and the Aggregate

<P align="center" style="font-size: 12pt"><B>THE AGENTS</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">Section&nbsp;10.1 <U>Appointment and Authority</U>. Each of the Banks and the Collateral Agent
appoints Bank of America N.A. to act on its behalf as the Administrative Agent hereunder and
authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such actions on its behalf and to exercise such powers
as are delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms hereof, together with such actions and
powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. Each of the Banks and the Administrative Agent
appoints Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas to act on its behalf as the Collateral Agent
hereunder and authorizes the Collateral Agent to take such actions on its behalf and to exercise
such powers as are delegated to the Collateral Agent by the terms hereof together with such actions
and powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. The provisions of this Article are solely for the
benefit of the Agents and the Banks, and the Company shall not have rights as a third party
beneficiary of any of such provisions. It is understood and agreed that the use of the term
&#147;agent&#148; herein or in any other Loan Documents (or any other similar term) with reference to the
Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent is not intended to connote any fiduciary or other
implied (or express) obligations arising under agency doctrine of any applicable law. Instead such
term is used as a matter of market custom, and is intended to create or reflect only an
administrative relationship between contracting parties. Each Bank hereby authorizes the
Collateral Agent to execute each of the Collateral Documents on behalf of such Bank (the terms of
which shall be binding on such Bank) and to release any lien in any Collateral if such release is
provided for in any Loan Document or is otherwise consented to in accordance with <U>Section
9.2</U>.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">Section&nbsp;10.2 <U>Rights as a Bank</U>. The Person serving as an Agent hereunder shall have
the same rights and powers in its capacity as a Bank as any other Bank and may exercise the same as
though it were not an Agent and the term &#147;Bank&#148; or &#147;Banks&#148; shall, unless otherwise expressly
indicated or unless the context otherwise requires, include the Person serving as an Agent
hereunder in its capacity as a Bank. Such Person and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend
money to, act as the financial advisor or in any other advisory capacity for and generally engage
in any kind of business with the Company or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof as if such
Person were not an Agent hereunder and without any duty to account therefor to the Banks.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">Section&nbsp;10.3 <U>Exculpatory Provisions</U>. No Agent shall have any duties or obligations
except those expressly set forth herein and its duties hereunder shall be administrative in nature.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, no Agent:


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(a)&nbsp;shall be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default
has occurred and is continuing;


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(b)&nbsp;shall have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers,
except discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated hereby that such Agent is required to
exercise as directed in writing by the Required Banks (or such other number or percentage of the
Banks as shall be expressly provided for herein), <U>provided</U> that each Agent may refuse to
perform any duty or exercise any right or power unless it receives indemnity from the Banks
satisfactory to it against the costs, expenses and liabilities which might be incurred by it in
performing such duty or exercising such right or power; provided further that no Agent shall be
required to take any action that, in its opinion or the opinion of its counsel, may expose such
Agent to liability or that is contrary to this Agreement, any Loan Document or applicable law,
including for the avoidance of doubt any action that may be in violation of the automatic stay
under any Federal, state or foreign bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership, or similar law or that
may effect a forfeiture, modification or termination of property of a Defaulting Bank in violation
of any Federal, state or foreign bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership, or similar law; and


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(c)&nbsp;shall, except as expressly set forth herein, have any duty to disclose, or shall be liable
for the failure to disclose, any information relating to Holdings, the Company or any of its
Affiliates that is communicated to or obtained by the Person serving as an Agent or any of its
Affiliates in any capacity.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">No Agent shall be liable for any action taken or not taken by it (i)&nbsp;with the consent or at
the request of the Required Banks (or such other number or percentage of the Banks as shall be
necessary, or as such Agent shall believe in good faith shall be necessary, under the circumstances
as provided in <U>Sections&nbsp;9.2</U> and <U>Article&nbsp;IX</U> ) or (ii)&nbsp;in the absence of its own
gross negligence or willful misconduct as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final
and non-appealable judgment. No Agent shall be deemed to have knowledge of any Default unless and
until notice describing such Default is given in writing to such Agent by the Company or a Bank.
Without limitation of any other provision of this <U>Article&nbsp;X</U>, if any provision of this
Agreement or the other Loan Documents is silent or vague (as determined in the good faith of the
applicable Agent), each Agent shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any action
under this Agreement or the other Loan Documents if it shall not have received written instruction,
advice or concurrence of the Banks, as it deems appropriate.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">No Agent shall be required to expend or risk any of its own funds or otherwise incur any
liability, financial or otherwise, in the performance of any of its duties hereunder or under any
other Loan Document.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">No Agent shall be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (i)&nbsp;any
statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection with this Agreement, (ii)&nbsp;the
contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered hereunder or thereunder or in
connection herewith, (iii)&nbsp;the performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or
other terms or conditions set forth herein or therein or the occurrence of any Default, (iv)&nbsp;the
validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of this Agreement, any other Loan Document
or any other agreement, instrument or document, (v)&nbsp;the existence, genuineness, value (other than
as expressly provided by <U>Section&nbsp;1.4</U> with respect to the Collateral Agent) or protection of
any Collateral, for the legality, effectiveness or sufficiency of any Collateral Document, or for
the creation, perfection, priority, sufficiency or protection of any Liens securing the Secured
Obligations or (vi)&nbsp;the satisfaction of any condition set forth in <U>Article&nbsp;V</U> or elsewhere
herein, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to such Agent.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">For the avoidance of doubt, nothing herein or the other Loan Documents shall require the
Collateral Agent to file financing statements or continuation statements, or be responsible for
maintaining the security interests purported to be created as described herein (except for the safe
custody of any Collateral in its possession and the accounting for moneys actually received by its
hereunder or under any other Loan Document).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">Section&nbsp;10.4 <U>Reliance by Agents.</U> Each Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall

instrument, document or other writing (including any electronic message, Internet or intranet
website posting or other distribution) believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed, sent
or otherwise authenticated by the proper Person. Each Agent also may rely upon any statement made
to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to have been made by the proper Person, and shall
not incur any liability for relying thereon. In determining compliance with any condition
hereunder to the making of a Loan, which by its terms must be fulfilled to the satisfaction of a
Bank, the Administrative Agent may presume that such condition is satisfactory to such Bank unless
the Administrative Agent shall have received notice to the contrary from such Bank prior to the
making of such Loan. Each Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the
Company), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any
action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or
experts.

its rights and powers by or through their respective Related Parties. The exculpatory provisions
of this Article shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Related Parties of such Agent and any
such sub-agent, and shall apply to their respective activities in connection with the syndication
of the credit facilities provided for herein as well as activities as such Agent. No Agent shall
be responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any sub-agents except to the extent such Agent
acted with bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct in the selection of such sub-agents.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(a)&nbsp;Each Agent may at any time give notice of its resignation to the Banks and the Company.
Further, the Company and the Required Banks may, in the event that an Agent shall become unable to
fulfill any of its duties hereunder (as determined by the Company in its reasonable discretion) or
upon mutual agreement, from time to time request (an &#147;<B>Agent Removal Request</B>&#148;) another Bank to act
as the &#147;Administrative Agent&#148; or &#147;Collateral Agent&#148; hereunder. Upon receipt of any such notice of
resignation or request, the Required Banks shall have the right, with the consent of the Company
(not to be unreasonably withheld), to appoint a successor, which shall be a bank or trust company
with an office in the United States. If no such successor Agent shall have been so appointed by
the Required Banks with such consent of the Company and shall have accepted such appointment within
30&nbsp;days after the retiring Agent gives notice of its resignation (or such earlier day as shall be
agreed by the Company and the Required Banks) or 30&nbsp;days after such Agent Removal Request (the
&#147;<B>Resignation Effective Date</B>&#148;), then the retiring Agent may on behalf of the Banks upon 30&nbsp;days&#146;

<U>provided</U> that, if the applicable Agent shall notify the Company and such Banks that no
qualifying Person has accepted such appointment or if such Agent has elected not to appoint such a
successor Agent, then such resignation shall nonetheless become effective in accordance with such
notice on the Resignation Effective Date and with effect from the Resignation Effective Date (1)
the retiring Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder (except that in
the case of any collateral security held by the Collateral Agent on behalf of the Banks under any
of the Loan Documents, the retiring or removed Collateral Agent shall continue to hold such
collateral security until such time as a successor Collateral Agent is appointed) and (2)&nbsp;except
for any indemnity payments or other amounts then owed to the retiring Agent, all payments,
communications and determinations provided to be made by, to or through such Agent shall instead be
made by or to each Bank directly, until such time as a successor Agent is appointed by the Required
Banks or such Agent, as applicable (in each case, with the consent of Company, not to be
unreasonably withheld), as provided for above in this Section. Upon the acceptance of a
successor&#146;s appointment as Agent hereunder, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with
all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring (or retired) Agent (other than any
rights to indemnity payments or other amounts owed to the retiring or removed Agent as of the
Resignation Effective Date), and the retiring Agent shall be discharged from all of its duties and
obligations hereunder (if not already discharged therefrom as provided above in this Section). The
fees payable by the Company to a successor Agent shall be the same as those payable to its
predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the Company and such successor. After the retiring
Agent&#146;s resignation or removal hereunder, the provisions of this Article and <U>Section&nbsp;11.8</U>
shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring Agent, its sub-agents and their
respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them
while the retiring Agent was acting as such Agent.

of an &#147;Applicable Tranche Swingline Bank&#148; provided for hereunder with respect to Applicable Tranche
Swingline Loans made by it and outstanding as of the effective date of such resignation, including
the right to require the Banks to make Applicable Tranche Revolving Loans or fund risk

will, independently and without reliance upon any Agent or any other Bank or any of their Related

(irrespective of whether the principal of any Loan shall then be due and payable as herein
expressed or by declaration or otherwise and irrespective of whether the Administrative Agent shall
have made any demand on the Company) shall be entitled and empowered, by intervention in such
proceeding or otherwise:

Agent to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Bank any plan of
reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the obligations hereunder or the
rights of any Bank to authorize the Administrative Agent to vote in respect of the claim of any
Bank in any such proceeding.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">The Banks hereby irrevocably authorize the Collateral Agent, at the direction of the Required
Banks (and the Administrative Agent), to credit bid all or any portion of the Obligations

acquisition vehicle or vehicles that are used to consummate such purchase).&nbsp; In connection with any
such bid (i)&nbsp;the Collateral Agent with the consent of the Administrative Agent shall be authorized

giving effect to the limitations on actions by the Required Banks contained in <U>Section&nbsp;9.2</U>
of this Agreement), and (C)&nbsp;to assign the relevant Obligations to any such acquisition vehicle pro

assigned to an acquisition vehicle are not used to acquire Collateral for any reason (as a result
of another bid being higher or better, because the amount of Obligations assigned to the

<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(a)&nbsp;The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the
parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns, <U>provided</U> that (i)&nbsp;the Company
may not assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement except

be null and void) and (ii)&nbsp;no Bank may assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or
obligations under this Agreement except in accordance with this <U>Section&nbsp;11.1</U>.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(b)&nbsp;(i)&nbsp;Any Bank may, in accordance with applicable law, at any time sell to one or more
banks, financial institutions or other entities (&#147;<B>Participants</B>&#148;) participating interests in any
Applicable Tranche Revolving Loan owing to such Bank, any Applicable Tranche Commitment of such
Bank or any other interest of such Bank hereunder. In the event of any such sale by a Bank of
participating interests to a Participant, such Bank&#146;s obligations under this Agreement to the other
parties to this Agreement shall remain unchanged, such Bank shall remain solely responsible for the
performance thereof and the Company and each Agent shall continue to deal solely and directly with
such Bank in connection with such Bank&#146;s rights and obligations under this Agreement and the other
Loan Documents. Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Bank sells such a participating
interest shall provide that such Bank shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to
approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement and in no event
shall a Bank that sells a participating interest be obligated to the Participant to take or refrain
from taking any action hereunder or under any of the other Loan Documents except that such Bank may
agree that it will not, without the consent of such Participant, agree to (A)&nbsp;reduce the principal

the Loans or other obligations under this Agreement (the &#147;<B>Participant Register</B>&#148;); <U>provided</U>
that no Bank shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register
to any Person (including the identity of any Participant or any information relating to a
Participant&#146;s interest in any Applicable Tranche Commitment, or Loans or its other obligations
under any Loan Document) except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that
such Applicable Tranche Commitment, or, Revolving Loan or other obligation is in registered form
under Section&nbsp;5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations. The entries in the
Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Bank shall treat each
person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for
all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary.

Tranche Commitments have been terminated, its Loans under such Applicable Tranche (as the case may
be), pursuant to an assignment agreement (an &#147;<B>Assignment Agreement</B>&#148;), executed by such Assignee and
such Bank and delivered to the Company and each Agent; <U>provided</U> that the consent of the
Company (and the consent of the Administrative Agent, solely with respect to clauses (B)&nbsp;and (C))

such execution and delivery of an Assignment Agreement, from and after the effective date as
specified therein, (x)&nbsp;the Assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and shall be bound by the
provisions hereto and, to the extent provided in such Assignment Agreement, shall have the rights
and obligations of a Bank hereunder, with respect to its Applicable Tranche Commitment as set forth
in such Assignment Agreement, and (y)&nbsp;the transferor Bank thereunder shall, to the extent provided
in such Assignment Agreement, be released from its obligations under this Agreement with respect to
its Applicable Tranche Commitments being assigned (and, in the case of an Assignment Agreement
covering all or the remaining portion of a transferor Bank&#146;s rights and obligations under this
Agreement, such transferor Bank shall cease to be a party hereto, but shall continue to be entitled

Tranche Commitment, recorded therein for all purposes of this Agreement. Except in the case of an
assignment of the entire remaining amount of the assigning Bank&#146;s Applicable Tranche Commitment
under an Applicable Tranche or Loans under an Applicable Tranche, the amount of the Applicable
Tranche Commitment under an Applicable Tranche or Loans under an Applicable Tranche of the
assigning Bank subject to each such assignment (determined as of the date the Assignment Agreement
with respect to such assignment is delivered to the Administrative Agent) shall not be less than
$25,000,000 and each continuing assigning Bank shall retain an Applicable Tranche Commitment of not
less than $25,000,000, unless each of the Company and the Administrative Agent otherwise consent,
<U>provided</U> that no such consent of the Company shall be required if a Default under any of
<U>Sections&nbsp;8.2</U>, <U>8.6</U> or <U>8.7</U> has occurred and is continuing. Any assignment or
transfer by a Bank that does not comply with this <U>Section&nbsp;11.1</U> shall be treated for
purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Bank of a participating interest in such rights and
obligations in accordance with <U>subsection 11.1(b)</U>.

(which existing Note shall be surrendered to the Company) to the order of the transferor Bank
reflecting (if requested by such transferor Bank) the Applicable Tranche Commitment and outstanding
Loans thereunder retained by it hereunder. Such new Notes shall be dated the effective date of the
Assignment Agreement as specified therein, and (if requested as described above) include reference
to the Applicable Tranche Commitment and shall otherwise be in the form of the Note replaced
thereby. The Note surrendered by the transferor Bank shall be returned by the transferor Bank to
the Company marked &#147;canceled&#148;. The Administrative Agent, acting for this purpose as an agent of
the Company, shall maintain at one of its offices a copy of each Assignment Agreement delivered to
it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Banks, and the Applicable
Tranche Commitment of, and principal amount (and stated interest) of the Loans owing under each
Applicable Tranche to, each Bank pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the &#147;<B>Register</B>&#148;).

Banks shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof
as the owner of its interest therein, as indicated in the Register, for all purposes of this
Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. The Register shall be available for inspection
by the Company and any Bank, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior

required to deduct any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes from such payments, then (i)&nbsp;the sum
payable shall be increased by the amount (the &#147;<B>Additional Amount</B>&#148;) necessary so that after making
all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums described in this
paragraph) such Bank receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such
deductions been made, (ii)&nbsp;the Company shall make such deductions and (iii)&nbsp;the Company shall pay
the full amount deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.
In addition, to the extent not paid in accordance with the preceding sentence, the Company shall
pay any Other Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.

Indemnified Taxes and Other Taxes paid by such Bank, provided, however, that the Company shall not
be obligated to make payment to any Bank in respect of penalties, interest and other similar
liabilities attributable to such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes if such penalties, interest or
other similar liabilities are reasonably attributable to the gross negligence or willful misconduct
of such Bank.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(c)&nbsp;If a Bank shall become aware that it is entitled to claim a refund from a Governmental
Authority in respect of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes paid by the Company pursuant to this

indemnified by the Company, or with respect to which the Company has paid Additional Amounts
pursuant hereto, it shall promptly notify the Company of the availability of such refund claim and,
if such Bank determines in good faith that making a claim for refund will not have a material
adverse effect on its taxes or business operations, shall, within 30&nbsp;days after receipt of a
request by the Company, make a claim to such Governmental Authority for such refund at the
Company&#146;s expense. If a Bank receives a refund in respect of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes
paid by the Company pursuant hereto, it shall within 30&nbsp;days from the date of such receipt pay over
such refund to the Company (but only to the extent of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes paid
pursuant to hereto, including indemnity payments made or Additional Amounts paid, by the Company

such refund), net of all out of pocket expenses of such Bank and without interest (other than
interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund). This Section

returns (or any other information relating to its taxes which it deems confidential) to the Company

request of the Company or the Administrative Agent, complete and deliver from time to time any
certificate, form or other document requested by the Company or the Administrative Agent, the
completion and delivery of which are a precondition to obtaining the benefit of such reduced rate
or exemption, <U>provided</U> that the taking of such action by such Bank, would not, in the
reasonable judgment of such Bank be disadvantageous or prejudicial to such Bank or inconsistent
with its internal policies or legal or regulatory restrictions. Subject to the above proviso, for
any period with respect to which a Bank has failed to provide any such certificate, form or other
document requested by the Company or the Administrative Agent, such Bank shall not be entitled to
any payment under this <U>Section&nbsp;11.3</U> in respect of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes that

Federal law requires all financial institutions to obtain, verify, record and update information
that identifies each Person that opens an account, including any deposit account, treasury
management account, loan, other extension of credit, or other financial services product.
Accordingly, when the Company opens an account, the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent and
the Banks will ask for the Company&#146;s name, tax identification number, business address, and other
information that will allow the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent and the Banks to
identify the Company. The Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent and the Banks may also ask to
see the Company&#146;s legal organizational documents or other identifying documents.

of evaluating, and understands and accepts, the terms, risks and conditions of the transactions
contemplated hereby; (ii) (A)&nbsp;the Agents, the Banks and the Arrangers each is and has been acting
solely as a principal and, except as expressly agreed in writing by the relevant parties, has not
been, is not, and will not be acting as an advisor, agent or fiduciary for the Company or any of

case may be, of any sum adjudged to be so due in the Judgment Currency, such Agent or such Bank, as
the case may be, may in accordance with normal banking procedures purchase the Agreement Currency
with the Judgment Currency. If the amount of the Agreement Currency so purchased is less than the
sum originally due to any Agent or any Bank from the Company in the Agreement Currency, the Company
agrees, as a separate obligation and notwithstanding any such judgment, to indemnify such Agent or
