2.       Paragraph  2(a) of the  Agreement  is deleted in its  entirety  and the
         following is inserted: On or before January 15, 2005 (the "Registration
         Date"),   the  Company  shall  file  a   registration   statement  (the

         the  maximum  number  of  shares  of  Common  Stock to be  issued  upon
         conversion  of the Preferred  Stock and exercise of the  Warrants.  The
         Company shall use its best efforts to have the  Registration  Statement
         declared  effective  within 80 days after the  initial  filing with the
         SEC. Once effective,  the Company shall maintain the  effectiveness  of
         the  Registration  Statement until the earlier of (i) the date that all
         of the Registrable Securities have been sold, or (ii) the date that the
         Company  receives an opinion of counsel to the Company  that all of the
         Registrable  Securities may be freely traded without registration under
         the Securities Act, under Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act
         or otherwise.

3.       Paragraph  2(b) of the  Agreement  is deleted in its  entirety  and the
